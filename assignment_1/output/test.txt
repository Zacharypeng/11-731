you know , one of the great <unk> , and the one of the joys of the most of life , in common with people who can remember the old days , and they can touch rocks in the <unk> rocks they <unk> into the bitter leaves of plants .
simply that , that is still beyond the milky way to travel beyond the milky way , or that in the himalayas the buddhist <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> , which is to be successful in a sense of generations ago .
and of course , we share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
we &apos;re going through <unk> .
we have to be <unk> by the <unk> divide through death and so that we didn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dancing and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the <unk> in the forests of spain , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior , in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> of the <unk> , everest , the world &apos;s <unk> of the world . everest , the world &apos;s <unk> .
all of these people teach us that there are other more than others , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking of the orientation on earth .
and that &apos;s a notion that if you think about it , you can just meet a hope .
together , the <unk> of the world are a network of <unk> and <unk> lives that the earth is as important as the biological <unk> that you know as a biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , and <unk> , as the most cosmopolitan of all thoughts and dreams , myths , <unk> , and intuitions that the human imagination has been generated by consciousness since the beginning of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we &apos;re looking at is amazing <unk> species .
and just like the biosphere was emptied , this was even more speed with the <unk> -- just with even lower speed .
no biologist would argue that 50 percent or more of all species before that , because it &apos;s not true , and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> on the field of biological diversity -- almost almost what we known as a <unk> <unk> in the field of cultural diversity .
and the key indicator of this is the <unk> of languages .
and when any of you were born in this room , on the world , 6,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the whole of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a means with the soul of a given to a given to the tangible world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , a a sense , a thought , an ecosystem spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting in monterey , which is exactly half , in the <unk> of children &apos;s ears .
they &apos;re not taught by infants . that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be done , is actually dead .
what could be lonely , as a silence , to be a to be a to be a to be one of the last to your language , the wisdom of the ancestors , the wisdom of the ancestors , or the hope of hope children ?
and yet , this horrible accomplishment actually actually tell someone anywhere on earth , about all two weeks , because every two weeks , a elderly dies and takes the last <unk> of a old language with her grave .
and i know that some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; if we all talk a language , if we all talk a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , &quot; will be married in his language . let &apos;s be <unk> .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then you would suddenly recognize how it would be if you don &apos;t talk your language .
so i &apos;d like to take a trip through a journey through the <unk> , a brief journey through the <unk> , to try to make them understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now , there are some of us in the way that i &apos;m saying , when i say , &quot; various ways of being , &quot; really , various ways of being mine .
take the example of this kid who &apos;s <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people who <unk> believe that they were <unk> the <unk> of the east <unk> from the east belly of holy serpent .
that &apos;s a people who doesn &apos;t have cognitively between the colors and green , because the <unk> of the forest that are dependent on the people .
they have a strange language and a <unk> who is called a linguistic <unk> , you have to talk someone who speaks to a different language .
all of this is roots in the <unk> past , and that strange about these big houses where the <unk> of six or seven languages are talked about , but you never hear someone who learns a language .
you just listen to and start talking to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first year was served after being served .
in 1957 , five <unk> <unk> would be <unk> and made a <unk> mistake .
they threw out <unk> pictures of the air , which is what we tracked as a friendly gesture , and that that these people had never seen the people out of the rainforest in their lives .
they took these photographs from the ground , trying to see the character or the figure out there &apos;s nothing and <unk> that this was business business of the devil , killing the five <unk> of the <unk> .
but the <unk> , not just <unk> , and with a spear .
they &apos;re <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths have been through <unk> .
we went back to eight generations , and found two cases of a natural death , and when we had to <unk> people with a <unk> about that , and we killed it by his age , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear place of forests , which was amazing .
their hunter could smell the urine of 40 and to smell , and determine what kind of was that owned .
in the early years of years , i was really a amazing job when i was my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in haiti and <unk> and the poison societies , and the poison that was used to make a <unk> of making it .
to give a sense of that <unk> , of course , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief in the knowledge of knowledge and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
on the opposite , it &apos;s a complex kind of metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you , the great world world would have to be reckoned what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , whatever .
a continent is going out , because the presumption was that it doesn &apos;t have religious belief in sub-saharan africa , of course , there was one and <unk> , is just the little very profound religious thought that during the tragic diaspora of the tragic diaspora .
but what makes you so interesting is that this live relationship between the living and the dead .
the living is the shake the spirits .
the spirits can be <unk> by the big water , and the <unk> of the dance to the rhythm of the living , to deny the <unk> of the living , so that the <unk> <unk> is for a brief moment for god .
<unk> says the <unk> , &quot; your white is goes to church and you know about god .
we dance in the temple , and become god . &quot;
and because it &apos;s obsessed with , you &apos;re going to be done by the mind , how can you get damage ?
see this amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , the coal coal , a remarkable visualization of the ability to influence the body so that this it &apos;s <unk> when it &apos;s going to be a state of the extreme excitement .
now , from all people who i met was the <unk> of the sierra nevada , de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most exceptional .
the offspring of the ancient <unk> civilization , the the the institute of the <unk> , and in the conquest , the people in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> over the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people who have never been the <unk> who were ever been from the <unk> .
and to the day today , you will be governed by a ritual priesthood , proteomics that &apos;s an <unk> <unk> system , but very exceptional .
the young <unk> are separated at the age of three and four years of their families , and in a <unk> world of darkness , in <unk> at the base of the glacier for 18 years , and they &apos;re employing two time from every nine years , to take their mother months in the <unk> of the great mother .
and during all of time , they will be culturally in the values of their society , and values that are the claim that their prayers and just their prayers , the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance .
and the end of this amazing <unk> , they &apos;re all out to be out and the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , you see a <unk> . and in this <unk> moment of consciousness of the first light , when the sun is actually , &quot; look back ?
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this is the very important thing that is very important .
and whenever we think about native and landscape , we either have <unk> and the old kind of the very noble of the very noble <unk> , which is a <unk> thought , or the other , and say , these people are more with nature than we .
so , native , neither <unk> , nor are not <unk> , they &apos;re not registered by the <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have a lot of place in the <unk> of <unk> or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have a <unk> <unk> of the earth , which is not on the idea of being aware of the idea , but it &apos;s a very far <unk> intuition that can be the earth itself because it &apos;s going to be <unk> into the human consciousness
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the andes that &apos;s where the one is a <unk> of the <unk> , who will be a <unk> , who will be a <unk> of the , and a a little kid from montana , which is a half of rocks that can be eaten .
if he &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a pile of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor that which is the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia and believed that these forests are being <unk> .
that made me to another person than my friends under the <unk> who believe that these forests of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> spirits the world &apos;s <unk> in the world &apos;s <unk> , ghosts that they were involved in their <unk> .
well , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , and like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph that i took off the last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard , the most powerful <unk> preparation from the repertoire of the .
what makes it fascinating is that is not just the <unk> potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s actually made from two different sources . on one hand , there &apos;s a little bit of <unk> . on one side , there &apos;s a little bit of <unk> .
this plant has a lot very strong <unk> that are very much very much that are very similar to serotonin , <unk> and <unk> .
if you saw the <unk> , you saw this stuff , this substance that they create in different ways of it .
this powder is a <unk> shot , just like a <unk> shot , <unk> of <unk> paintings and the landing ocean of electricity .
it doesn &apos;t create distortion of reality , but the unraveling of reality .
i even have my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> in mexico , discussing it , and that &apos;s where you feel the implications of the effects , you don &apos;t feel that in order to learn a <unk> .
but the thing that is about is that they can &apos;t be <unk> , because it &apos;s a in the human intestines , of course , ice with <unk> , <unk> .
they can only be absorbed in conjunction with some other chemicals that &apos;s mao <unk> .
now the fascinating is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> of these are , <unk> are the way that is necessary to <unk> the <unk> , so questions themselves .
how can these people from geological species , <unk> plants that have not <unk> these two strains of plants that are combined with this way that this is the whole greater than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which is meaningless .
but you ask the indians say , &quot; the plant is to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 versions of <unk> that they all see at a lot of distance in the woods that appear to our eyes as a kind .
and then you ask them how she can write their <unk> and say , &quot; i thought you understand something of plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so it turns out that each of the 17 varieties of <unk> , and they sing them in a different <unk> .
now , this is not a doctor &apos;s <unk> , but it &apos;s a much more interesting than counting .
now , the problem is the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the <unk> of the <unk> , they look at the <unk> and <unk> , but they &apos;re kind of looking at the past , but in fact , it &apos;s kind of limited to the past , as the real world , meaning the real world .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century in 300 years , in 300 years , not remember the era of the and the massive devastation of biological and cultural diversity on earth either active or passively accepted .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> stopped being less on the sioux as they and the <unk> and the americans stopped the americans , and they &apos;re <unk> tasks .
not change and technology , the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the regime .
and where you &apos;re going to see in the world , you will find that these cultures are not going to fall down the fall of the the <unk> , and that &apos;s dynamic , dynamically , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , and in the case of the <unk> , where it &apos;s <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
or if we go into the hills of tibet , where i &apos;m looking at a lot of research , you see the ugly face of the political predators .
you know , the genocidal , the genocidal , the <unk> extinction is going to be a general , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lives of the lives of life , not only not a story , but generally and <unk> as a part of a drug .
and they can &apos;t understand the suffering if you don &apos;t have experienced it on the <unk> level .
i spent a young colleagues 6,000 miles from <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and when i saw the face of the statistics you hear , 6,000 holy monuments , who were being killed by the cultural cultural revolution .
the father was being <unk> as a followers of the <unk> lama .
that meant he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle fled to their holiness in the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother was incarcerated as punishment for -- for the crimes of being in the crime .
he was in the age of two years of prison in order to hide under her <unk> , because they couldn &apos;t live without it .
the sister who did this bold <unk> , was brought into a <unk> .
and one day she stepped out on an <unk> and for this <unk> , she had to to seven years of labor for seven years .
the suffering can be <unk> , but the most <unk> &apos;s mind is something called a little bit .
and the end is we really , we want to a choice . we want to be in a <unk> world of the <unk> or in a <unk> world of the diversity ?
margaret <unk> , who was great anthropologist before she died , that it &apos;s her most of us to see that while we &apos;re moving towards a way , <unk> , <unk> in the way , we &apos;ve ever been waking up from a dream and forgotten that there was ever other choices .
and it &apos;s <unk> to think that our species may have existed for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and we had to the cult of the cult cult of the <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> the poetry of <unk> and <unk> , and he found out 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know , is not about 300 years old .
now , this shallow story tells me that we all have all answers to the challenges that we &apos;re in the ensuing millennia .
if we have these whole whole bunch of <unk> to the human human , you respond with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will be the opportunity to be the way we &apos;re : people who are important to be aware of all people and gardens to make a space to be <unk> , and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took off the north of the <unk> , when i went to the <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit , and during the <unk> years , in the process of <unk> of our regime , they were forced to draw in settlements .
the <unk> of that old man refused .
the family , who was afraid to his life , took him all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit are not afraid of the cold , they use them to their advantage .
the <unk> of their <unk> , was originally being made by fish that was wrapped in <unk> .
the <unk> of man didn &apos;t have to be afraid of the the arctic night or the the wall of the wall .
he <unk> out after , left his pants off <unk> and put it into his pants , and when the fecal was too cold , he shaped her into the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> <unk> on the sides of the <unk> and and it was completely frozen , he was a dog .
he <unk> the dog and pan <unk> a a a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a dog <unk> , and <unk> on the <unk> on the dock at the belt belt .
that &apos;s how you can do anything .
and this is a lot of a symbol for the opposition of the inuit and all the world in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 , the complete control over a field that is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country &apos;s new and called <unk> .
it &apos;s an active area . they all control the <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state who can look for people who can reach and achieve .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are to the distant destinations of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of someone .
they represent the human imagination that are <unk> in the past , and for all of us , are the dreams of these children , like dreams of our own children &apos;s in the geography of hope .
what we &apos;re doing with national geographic , we believe that politicians never achieve anything .
we believe that <unk> -- we think don &apos;t think about <unk> is not compelling , but we think that storytelling is the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website is going to get 35 million <unk> <unk> every month .
156 nations send our <unk> .
our magazines are being read by millions .
and we do a series of trips into the <unk> of which we take to the places of such cultural wonders that they would take from the kind of <unk> and hopefully , you will find a <unk> in a really multicultural <unk> in the wisdom of all people to our common well-being .
thank you .
what i first is to do is to be able to show as quickly as possible , the basic work , a new technology that we microsoft is a part of a year ago , you have to have local numbers from visual data .
we see many , many of the <unk> of digital photographs here , which you can seamlessly and <unk> the <unk> , in a particular way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these things are or how big these things are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this is an scan of the <unk> and it &apos;s in a field of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that can be a system like that , the number of pixel on your screen , at every moment , it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house by dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not to be a picture , we can do something like this to actually show that this one real representation of the <unk> and not an image .
maybe this is a artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a braille one is the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that &apos;s really , the pleasure of the pleasure and the good experience to read a a newspaper or a newspaper , which is a sort of a different medium .
we also have something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high resolution that is much more than in a normal display , and we added added extra content .
if you want to see the functions of this cars , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this is really getting these ideas to try to try and try to solve those limitations on the disease .
we hope that that means that it &apos;s not going to be <unk> and others , it should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we will be involved in this field .
but these are all the streets in the u.s.
<unk> on the <unk> picture of nasa .
now , let &apos;s take another step out now .
now this is actually live in the internet . they can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which is really two different technologies together .
and that is a <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> , the by the <unk> , a <unk> of washington , in the <unk> of steve <unk> in the <unk> of steve <unk> .
and rick <unk> of microsoft research was done , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that if we create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of the <unk> resolution .
but the spatial orientation of the images here is actually important .
the <unk> have put these pictures together so that they put these pictures together , which those recordings which are made in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> , are the elements of <unk> slides or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in the relationship .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i &apos;ve got time to give you other environments .
there are the ones that are much more <unk> .
i &apos;d like to leave right one of the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> and this is from a early prototype of <unk> that we first worked in the summer , to show you what i think is that it &apos;s really evident to the punchline that we think of the environments we &apos;ve got on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers of the lawyers .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral notre dame , who put it all in the computer with pictures of flickr . put them on <unk> and they &apos;re discovered images of men in t-shirts and on the <unk> and and on the <unk> and and on the <unk> and and on the <unk> and and on the <unk> and and on the <unk> and and on the <unk>
so this is all <unk> , and they all have in the in the way that in the relationship in the way .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
and , you know , i &apos;ve never believed that i will work in microsoft .
i &apos;m very thankful for the reception here .
and i suspect you can see that this is a lot of different types of cameras : everything is the <unk> of the professionals , a pretty large number of you all of them in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange strange .
many of you are covered by faces .
there &apos;s a series of photographs , here , here are you .
this is actually a pasting by dame dame that was right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is here that we can do things with social environments , and it &apos;s now collected data from all -- from all the whole collective of the , how visual earth looks like -- and everything is connected .
all these photographs are connected to each other and it creates something that is larger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from the earth .
now , look at this as the continuation of the work of what stephen <unk> on virtual earth .
and that &apos;s something that is through the complexity that people use it , and it is growing and using it &apos;s bigger for the user &apos;s electricity .
their own photos are <unk> with the <unk> that one other person .
if someone had done it , and all of them have been labeled and tells you who all are , then my photo of the notre notre <unk> , the <unk> of all of the data , and i can use it as a way of <unk> <unk> <unk> in social experience .
and of course , <unk> of all of these are immense potential to any interesting part of the earth that can &apos;t just be through <unk> or cooperation and so on the way of collective memory .
thank you .
and i understand it right ? your software is that at a particular time , within the next years , all the images that are used in common in the world , in order to connect with each other ?
yeah . it doesn &apos;t do anything else .
if you want to create a <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the abundance of the <unk> of the information that have a lot of these pictures .
like , as you do a <unk> for pictures , where you put phrases and the text of the website , a lot of information about that is that image .
but how about the image you put it with all your pictures ?
and then the circumference of the <unk> and the abundance that makes it makes , really is , really , it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , this is really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , and i hope in unison with other things you &apos;ve already heard already , and i &apos;m going to make myself a few connections in case you haven &apos;t been struck .
i want to start with what i call &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
the official <unk> works like this : if our aim is to maximize the common good of our citizens , it &apos;s about all the <unk> of the freedom of the individuals .
the reason for this is that freedom is good , is valuable , make sense , a <unk> premise for the human .
when people have freedom , then each of us are about to do the things that maximize our good good to decide and not to decide for us .
the path to maximize freedom is choice .
the more choices people have more freedom , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more good good .
this is , i think so deep in our water supply , that none of it would come to mind in the sense of it would be to question .
and it &apos;s also deeply deeply in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we can do about doing modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say something about <unk> &apos;s about <unk> .
there &apos;s 175 <unk> in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t <unk> the 10 different extra <unk> and 12 <unk> that you could buy a large array of their <unk> <unk> in the unlikely case that none of the buyer is going on the store for her .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> store to a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and in this one electronics there &apos;s so many <unk> plants .
we can put together <unk> million different varieties of <unk> plants that will be marketed in this one .
you have to admit that that &apos;s a great choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because i was able to rent any phone , who was the <unk> , as long as he came from mama bell .
they rented her phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of that was that the phone was never broken .
that days are over .
we now have almost an infinite selection of telephones , particularly in the world of the mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite favorite is the in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> .
and if you don &apos;t have seen it until you have seen in your business , you can be sure it will be soon .
and what it does is bringing people to walk into business and to do this question .
you know , what &apos;s the answer to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy cell phones that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that &apos;s very much more than buying the objects that are the same explosion of choice .
health -- it &apos;s not longer the case in the united states that you go to doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to doctor and doctor , and doctor says , we could do a a , or we could make b. b.
a has these benefits and risk .
b is these benefits and risk . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
doctor says a has these benefits and risk and b has the benefits and risk .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy , &quot; it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , is a shift that makes responsibility for the responsibility for decisions about something -- the best health of the moral care -- the the best constitution .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for <unk> drugs for people like they and me , that , if you think about it , not make sense of it , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do you make us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you &apos;re expecting to call the doctor &apos;s doctor in the next morning and request a change to the change .
something like this as a result of the as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide .
we don &apos;t inherit identity , we invent them .
and we often we we &apos;re ourselves as we we want .
that means that every day she wake up on tomorrow , you have to decide what a kind of person to be .
in marriage and family , there was a time where the <unk> was , that almost everyone had one had one , and they could figure it as fast as they could , and then quickly , kids were able to get it .
the only real choice was &quot; who &quot; , not when , and not what they did .
now , it &apos;s all just too .
i teach a wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re very carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry , &quot; should i marry ?
should i marry married ? should i have children , or just a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
and they will answer these questions , whether it means all the tasks that i &apos;m going to do to do with you and not get good grade in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed as carl <unk> , which is that allowed us to work every minute from every day on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s a way that there &apos;s a corner that i will not tell you about that the <unk> works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedoms of choice we have to make decisions in work , again and again , and again , we should work or not work .
we can play in the football of watching , and we have our phone phone on a hip and our blackberry to other hip and our laptop probably to our laps on our laps .
and even if they &apos;re all passed off , every minute in the <unk> of the <unk> , we ask ourselves , &quot; should i take that call ?
should i answer that email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is it certainly your child &apos;s experience of the <unk> of your child &apos;s experience of your child &apos;s experience .
everywhere we look , big things and things , tangible things and lifestyle , and life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived in the way .
so , i want to say , there were some choices , but not all the one question of choice .
and the world in which we &apos;re in now is like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to be bad about it .
all these choice have two effects , two negative effects on humans .
a effect , a <unk> way , is that it &apos;s <unk> it <unk> .
so many options options , you can choose it , it &apos;s very hard to decide to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of an example of a screening study about investing in volunteers .
one of me , from me , access to <unk> , the giant <unk> of <unk> employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 year-old employer to participate in the <unk> , the attendance .
they &apos;re offering 50 <unk> of <unk> -- 10 percent less employees than if they would give it five five , why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> that are the choices that is so hard to decide what you want to choose to choose it <unk> into tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never .
understand that it &apos;s not just meant to eat food food if they have to <unk> , because they don &apos;t have enough money to the his own , it also means that they &apos;re missing great <unk> of their employer .
through the <unk> , to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> , who &apos;d been happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it &apos;s incentive to make the world like this .
you want to make the decision really make really well if it &apos;s all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the fake fund , or even the wrong thing .
so that &apos;s a effect . the other effect is that even if we &apos;ve come to transcend paralysis and make a decision , we end with less pleased with the result of the choices , as if we had the opportunity to choose to choose less choices .
and there &apos;s several reasons for this .
one of them is that it takes through the great array of different <unk> if you buy a purchase , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and that &apos;s a <unk> right -- it &apos;s just perfect ? it &apos;s just to imagine that you have a good choice .
the more options , the more , the more , it &apos;s not to regret that is disappointing to the election you meet .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has a big issue in this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things about what we &apos;re about .
well , if there &apos;s lots of alternative to remember , it &apos;s just attractive to imagine attractive qualities of alternative that you exclude , that makes you with the alternatives that they &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here is what they &apos;d have to have .
here &apos;s a couple of on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great afternoon . they all have it for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; damn &quot; man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
every one in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right on my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s going to have two weeks from the thought he &apos;s going to have missed the opportunity to have a great parking lot day .
<unk> down the happiness that we get through our choices , even when we chose to have a fantastic .
and the more possibilities there are the more attractive properties of that choice in account for the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon a few of the story .
he makes a statement about it in now , and maybe to do things slowly .
but a more important thing he &apos;s doing is , is always who you decide for one thing , they don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have a attractive qualities , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less .
thirdly , the expectations of expectations .
this is what i was struck me when i was trying to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in the only jeans , and they bought them , and they bought them bad , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they had had lost enough enough , and they had had enough lost , they were starting to have the &quot; &quot;
so , to buy new jeans after a lot of years of the <unk> , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sales said , &quot; they want to be <unk> , lightly or <unk> ?
do you want buttons or <unk> ? stone or acid or acid .
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to go down , <unk> , blah , blah ... &quot; and so on the way he told .
my jaw was down , and after me , i was , &quot; i &apos;d like to love the way that was the only kind of thing . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i was going to wipe out of all the damn jeans and <unk> and that &apos;s the business -- and i say the truth -- the best jeans i ever had .
i was better . all these choices allowed me to have it better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain to myself .
the reason that i felt was a bad thing to feel that with all these benefits , my expectations for a good few jeans is going up .
i had very low expectations . i had no expectations than it was just in a kind of .
when they were in 100 species , it was a <unk> of them to be perfect .
and what i was doing was fine , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i was going to get to what i was expected , and what i had was shocked to what i expected .
the other thing that we &apos;re going to have is increasing the people &apos;s lives , the expectations of people have to be the way of the things that are going to be .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even when the results are good .
no one in the world of the <unk> knows this . because if you &apos;d , you didn &apos;t know what it &apos;s about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used to be better than anything was worse than anything was bad , it was a good thing for people to get some comfortable experience .
today , in the world we live in the world -- we &apos;re wealthy , developed , and the best for you can hope to hope is the things that you &apos;re hoping to be so good as you expect it .
they will never make a pleasant <unk> because their expectations , my aspirations , are <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what they all came to -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short moment ago -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have to do it better . i didn &apos;t have myself .
but it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
and finally , a consequence of the <unk> sitting sitting in a bad sitting sitting in a kind of a bad sitting , that if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you ask yourself why , who is responsible . what would you do ?
when hundreds of these kinds of things are available , and they buy one that &apos;s a <unk> , and ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question is : it &apos;s .
they could have better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , you feel <unk> about it , they accuse themselves .
clinical depression , kenya in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> of the depression , and also suicide , is that people have been so high , and then if you have to explain these experiences themselves , think it would be so high .
and so the <unk> that it is often better , objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remember you .
this is the official <unk> that we all think is wrong , it &apos;s not wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , which is a little bit of choice than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choice than something .
there &apos;s a magic amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed that time on the very long time that we have this point .
now , as a question , i &apos;m almost finished -- as a question , the thing that is about thinking about the thinking about what all these selection enabled in the interstate societies , is the material of wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of you , whose problem is not to the great choice .
her problem is that they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem problem with modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is : steve <unk> has talked about how to get these expensive and hard car seats , and it &apos;s hard to <unk> car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they even hurt .
they &apos;re worried that we are bad there .
if something of what the people of the people who allow people to make decisions that people were shifted into the societies wouldn &apos;t just be improved life , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a prospective application .
and it &apos;s going to worry that it &apos;s going to be all better -- not just the poor -- because all these great selection selection us .
finally , you please read this cartoon , and , a refined person , say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish ?
you know , there &apos;s nothing possible in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view of the fish that knows something .
because the truth is that if they break the <unk> , so it &apos;s possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis .
if they break the <unk> , so it &apos;s possible , you get the happiness .
they increase the paralysis and down the happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost to limited with perfect certainty , possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> of a metaphor is a recipe recipe for miserable , and , i suspect , in the case .
thank you very much .
you know , i talked about some of these projects earlier before , about the human genome and what that could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re actually going to be in a new point : we &apos;re digitized biology , now we &apos;re trying to get the digital code into a new stage of biology by creating new life and build .
we always tried to ask the important questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something that i think that many biologists are trying to understand that many biologists are trying to understand and at different levels .
we &apos;ve tried various ways to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years ago , when we &apos;ve sequenced the <unk> , <unk> was the shift from the analog world of biology in the digital world of the computer .
now let &apos;s try to ask whether we can regenerate , or whether we can make a new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , a pair of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to get that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it to about 100 genes , and we &apos;ve been there to about 100 genes , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re here .
but if we look at this metabolic map that is very simple in comparison with our own , and you know that &apos;s simple . but if we &apos;re looking at these genes that we can actually take to the other genes that would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it actually is the only way to synthesize the individual that allows us to vary the individual components and so to make some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
and enables that to make the chemistry of these really large molecules that was never done before ?
and , if we can that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is the way a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps in disrupted in the field of life , it was growing .
our ability to write genetic code has been very slow , but it &apos;s actually augmented , and our last point now , now on a exponential curve now .
we started this with 15 years ago .
it took a couple of years ago with a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out , it turns out very difficult .
there are thousands of machines around the world to create the small pieces of dna , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes you happen .
so we had to develop a new method with we could put these little pieces and error mistakes .
that was our first attempt to do , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills the bacteria .
we made little pieces , made a dna , and had a dna molecule by about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of bone chemical and into a bacterium , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were taken by the cells and they came back and <unk> e. coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they thought that model .
they were laughing more than her here .
so we think that &apos;s a situation in the software that is actually able to build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build an entire <unk> chromosome . it has more than <unk> letters genetic code . so we thought we were able to make it in cassette cassette of the virus that are the the the size of the living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information is really accurate .
and when we first sequenced the genome first sequenced , the <unk> <unk> was a 10,000 base base .
we found 30 mistakes , if we had the original sequence , if we had the original sequence , it never have been possible .
part of the design is to create pieces of the two letters long and the other bits of pieces have to make smaller <unk> to build smaller <unk> so that they fit together .
we &apos;ve got unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have built in <unk> .
think about this : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t.
now , the <unk> of these letters -- these letters spiral about 20 amino acids ; and there &apos;s one single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phrases , thoughts .
we &apos;ve just signed signed .
some people were shocked to be a poetry .
we &apos;ve designed the pieces so that we could easily break them with bacteria , and there are enzymes that repair these repair and then together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces of the patient to <unk> <unk> , put these together to <unk> these together to <unk> this back until <unk> .
in each step , we have this pieces of mass that we could sequence it , because we were trying to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get the to the bottom of the <unk> .
so , it looks like a <unk> .
and if we get to these big pieces -- with 100 pairs pairs pairs pairs -- and then it &apos;s not just in the <unk> of modern molecular biology , and so we actually used to take other mechanisms mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism called <unk> <unk> , which is using the biology to repair the dna that can assemble pieces of pieces .
here &apos;s an example of that . there &apos;s a organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field , that just fall down the chromosome .
12 hours later , it &apos;s got back together like this .
we &apos;ve got thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely <unk> , even in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that live in space and can move , looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually we &apos;ve been using <unk> using the right design of the pieces we put them into the right design , and yeast put it automatically .
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s so a big molecule that we can even see it with the <unk> .
that &apos;s been recorded over a time of 6 seconds .
that &apos;s the paper we &apos;ve just been asked recently .
this is over <unk> letters of <unk> code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that ever been created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we would contain it with a <unk> of <unk> , it would contain pages of a <unk> pages , just to just create this genetic code .
now how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a virus , it &apos;s a very simple thing . it &apos;s a lot more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier when you &apos;re in <unk> like we &apos;re doing : you just take the <unk> out and there &apos;s another in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about that cloning .
and in fact , the chromosome in the cell , we just recently showed that one of a chromosome from one cell to the other , and that can activate it .
we put the chromosome a <unk> . <unk> , these two are from the same way of humans and mice . we gave some <unk> of <unk> to destroy this chromosome . we were using enzymes to destroy all the proteins . and it was very amazing as we gave them into a cell -- and it was very amazing as we gave them into a cell -- and
the new chromosome was in the cell .
in fact , we thought that &apos;s the end , but we tried to bring the process .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all species here in the other chromosome , or a third of <unk> , every thousands of items in just a second one second .
so people who think evolution as a gene that has been missing a lot of biology .
there are enzymes that are called the dopamine receptor that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell , the chromosomes that we have put in .
it was <unk> in the cell , and he realized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we had a cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s blue because of genes we had put it .
and after a very short time , all of the characteristics of species lost and <unk> is completely entirely in a new species on the new software we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all proteins change the membranes changed the <unk> , and as we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve been .
it may sound like the genomic microwave sound , but we can use the <unk> , things quite dramatically change .
now , i argued that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s a 3.5 billion years ago evolution .
and i have argued that we could potentially be a new form of the cambrian explosion in which we could give massive new forms of applications on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to what we need .
we &apos;re in the process of six billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in the year in the year .
today , three people on this planet has been denied in this planet for every year , within 40 years , it will be four .
we have trouble with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel fuel for <unk> billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer for for 9 to nine .
we need to take over five billion tons of coal , dairy billion barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million drums on the day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we now have come from our discoveries from the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components , and you see the diversity of that came out of this .
we &apos;re going to be able to the boundaries of the biological reality and the of our imagination .
we &apos;ve now have technologies because of this rapid software to do what we call genetics genetics .
so we now have the opportunity to build a large robot that can create a large robot on the day .
if you imagine that 20 million different genes , or making these processes to optimize information to create more complex , or drugs new vaccines , we can change a small team more molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just selection selection . we can <unk> <unk> by chemicals , production of chemicals or <unk> <unk> and so on .
this is a photograph of really <unk> <unk> on that we &apos;re actually able to do with and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it is going to look like , we know exactly what what the genetic code is going to look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuels the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn in ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have the <unk> of the <unk> and third generation that will be coming out of a lot higher , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , how we think the only way that we think about that , without more than much more than the cost of their availability is to be , if we &apos;re co2 as a material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go to this path .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism we described to see in 1996 .
he lives in the sea , about <unk> miles deep , in almost <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s methane co2 in methane to use hydrogen than power .
we can see if we can use carbon dioxide , which could be easily <unk> , which is the co2 in fuel to be able to power this process .
within a brief period of time we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> goals like the <unk> of the entire <unk> industry . right ? if you don &apos;t do that at ted , where else ?
but as we work in the moment , the same approaches to vaccines in development .
and they &apos;ve seen it this year with flu flu , we &apos;ve been a year back and have a dollar to a little bit when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s going to be able to create <unk> vaccines in the <unk> .
that &apos;s what the future may possibly look like , you can be sped up with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and potentially <unk> .
we &apos;re light years from it to make people better . our goal is just that we have a chance to survive long enough to survive that might be . thank you .
so on the last ted conference , i was a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
now it &apos;s so far . and for all those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc , the the largest scientific experiment that was ever addressed -- 27 miles in the diameter .
and his job is to create the conditions which existed less than a <unk> second , the universe -- and that &apos;s to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
this is what i work . he &apos;s called a <unk> -- 44 feet in the diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas of the atlas of the atlas of the .
on the 10th of september last 10 year , the machine was the first time .
and this image was taken by atlas .
there &apos;s huge <unk> in the room room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> that the entire stages of the lhc , to a part of the lhc , to put a part of the lhc to put a <unk> of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image on september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a great terrifying .
i don &apos;t know if this was the largest <unk> of <unk> , or this , when someone went to google and the front door .
it means that we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific impact .
and about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with this wires -- these golden wires here here .
these wires are <unk> <unk> when the machine is on the <unk> .
now , engineers are under you and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do it . these are little wires . &quot;
they can afford it because if you closed them very far , they will be called the <unk> .
so if you &apos;re minus minus the space between the stars between the stars , can those wires the tension .
in one of the connections between the <unk> magnet , there was a <unk> .
and by heating , they heat up the spikes and <unk> <unk> , a sudden <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is even wonderful if you imagine that the magnet would weigh over 20 pounds of pounds , and moving around by about 30 inches .
so we effectively effectively effectively effectively , 50 of the magnet .
and they were going to take them out what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back to your path back .
by the end , the lhc will be <unk> .
we will turn it to turn it , and to be the first data on june or july , and we can put our journey on to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way , a kind of spark that &apos;s worth the value of science and <unk> to the borders . it &apos;s easy to reject it .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to reach beyond our borders , creating the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words with a english scientist , and <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> , when he was a <unk> experiments , his apprentice , michael <unk> , which was the <unk> of the human spirit , and that there are no new worlds to conquer our <unk> .
thank you .
i &apos;m a novelist .
and writing is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life of love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that is the change .
but the recent is a strange curious thing in my life and my career has been doing that led me to rethink my relationship to this work .
this strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> -- who went out , and a big <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is that i don &apos;t matter where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i &apos;m going to fall off crashing .
seriously -- the fall of <unk> !
for example , they get a very worried about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you don &apos;t fear that we will never <unk> ?
don &apos;t you fear that they were their entire life , and never create a book that was in the world ?
okay , that &apos;s really courage .
it would be worse , though i didn &apos;t remember that i was when i first told , i was when i first told the first time i told that i was the same kind of <unk> response to face .
people said , <unk> did you have no fear , never succeed ?
do you fear that you kill you to kill you the humiliation of a <unk> ?
do you fear that you &apos;re going to take your life for your life , and it &apos;s never going to be a <unk> <unk> dreams , your mouth filled with the bitter <unk> ?
that &apos;s how you know .
the answer to all these questions is : <unk> yes .
yeah , i fear all these things .
and i always had .
and i have more afraid of fear that would have a number of .
like algae -- and other things are things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this , and i &apos;m going to ask myself why ?
is it reasonable ?
is it logically that by someone should be expected to do the work to do the work ?
and what is the creative enterprise is that they are encouraged to us to make us about the other of the other of the other of the other , how other jobs don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , i was chemist , and i can remind myself a a situation in the 40 years ago , in the asked he was afraid to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how about it ?
it just wasn &apos;t it , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not given the <unk> of <unk> <unk> people .
we &apos;re writers , but they seem to have a kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but the creative of all <unk> , seem to be that reputation seem to have to be my tremendously unstable .
all you have to do is to look the bitter <unk> of really great minds , to look at the , the young and often died of their own hand .
and even those who didn &apos;t actually prevent their lives , seemed to be really neglected from their talents .
norman <unk> said she said his death in his last interview , <unk> every of my books , took me a little bit more .
a remarkable statement that you can do about their life &apos;s life .
but we don &apos;t even know if we hear someone to say something like that , because we &apos;ve heard this kind of statements for that long time . somehow we have the notion of the way that and collective of course -- that art -- the <unk> , and the art -- the <unk> .
the question i want to ask today is : is this idea for you all right ?
do you feel that ? because with just an inch , i &apos;m feeling with this particular notion .
i find them outrageous .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t know how they will get over into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we &apos;re going to encourage our great creative to live .
and i definitely know that it was -- in my situation , it would be very dangerous , to start , this dark path of reasoning , sort of <unk> -- particularly in the fact that i &apos;m in my career in my career .
that &apos;s called -- i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s probably very likely to do that all i &apos;m going to write about the world &apos;s worth of the world that came after the <unk> of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m saying it , because we &apos;re all of friends , and it &apos;s probably probably my greatest friends -- it &apos;s probably probably my greatest achievement .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
that &apos;s the kind of thought that someone can bring someone to get 9 &apos;s &apos;clock in the morning , gin and that &apos;s not .
i would rather than to do that work that i love .
so the question is , how ?
after some time of the <unk> , i think that i can continue to write a kind of <unk> psychological constructed .
somehow , i have to find a way of finding a <unk> , a a <unk> distance between me and my very natural <unk> , how the reaction is going to be on the writing .
while i was looking for models for looking for for the , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if you could help creative or more <unk> ideas about how to help the creative risks that are linked to creativity .
this is a search of greece , the old greece led to the old greece , and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will come back again .
but in the ancient greece , and rome didn &apos;t believe that creativity is from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which is from a distant , unknown source to the people -- from <unk> , &quot;
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity , demons <unk> .
from socrates , he believed he had a <unk> , who was screaming at a distance .
the roman had the same idea , which was called this kind of <unk> genius of genius .
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really thought that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was the kind of magic psychic creature that was believed that it lives in the walls of a <unk> -- about like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artist at work in practice , in a sense of work , in a sense of work , and the artist at work in practice .
this is brilliant -- because it &apos;s , there &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the psychological lessons that protect you from the following of your work .
and everyone knew that it worked so that was that ?
the artist of the <unk> was <unk> in a sense of what , for instance , too much more , right ?
if you were brilliant at all , you couldn &apos;t look at all the <unk> , and everyone knew that you had this <unk> genius , that helped you .
if your work is <unk> -- not entirely your fault , right ?
everyone knew , your genius was a <unk> .
so people thought in the west really thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance changed , and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was , let &apos;s put the human individual at the center of the universe -- all of the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for the <unk> creatures , the lead to the divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and the people started to believe that creativity came completely completely from their own individual .
the first time in history , you hear these or artists , a genius -- instead of which he &apos;s a genius .
i have to say to you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a person to allow him to do that he thinks he &apos;s like the basins and the the essence , the the way , the the whole thing , and the essence , is an infinite <unk> , is a tiny to a lot of responsibility to a lot of responsibility to a lot of responsibility .
it &apos;s like somebody to swallow the sun .
that &apos;s <unk> and distorted whole egos , and it creates all these <unk> expectations of success .
i think that this <unk> <unk> has been <unk> for the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just <unk> the <unk> of 500 years of <unk> in a <unk> lecture .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would just show up about the notion of -- basically -- <unk> , people who <unk> and <unk> people on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to to address is : why not ?
why not that ?
because it makes sense of the same way of all the other , that i &apos;ve heard about , when it went to explain perfectly crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that &apos;s -- like everybody knows that it &apos;s ever tried to do something -- so in other words , you &apos;re actually everyone here -- not always a reasonable .
in fact , he can feel like <unk> .
i recently met a encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone , who was now about 90 , but she told me she was her her , she told me she was in the <unk> virginia , she told me she was in the <unk> virginia , she told me she was going to be a book on the landscape .
she said it was like a <unk> train .
the story of the land on her .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew that she could do in a moment like that , and that was -- in her words , <unk> like the devil <unk> .
they ran out of the devil to the house during the presentation , and it was the only thing that she had to get a little bit enough to a sheet of paper and a pencil to it , so it &apos;s able to catch it through it , and it could catch it through it , and it could catch on the sheet .
in other painting , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she did not get the house and she would sing the book , she would go on the land and -- and she said , &quot; <unk> after a poet search for another poet .
and then , there were these moments -- i &apos;ll never forget forget -- she said that there was moments in which she was almost missed in the way .
so she runs to the house and he &apos;s looking for the paper and and she picks a pencil as it and then -- she said -- it was so as he would reach with her other hand and grab it to the answer .
she caught in his tail , and she pulled back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
and so , in the opportunities , the poem came running , and intact on paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first .
and when i thought that i thought , i was <unk> that is a very special thing -- that &apos;s what my creative process is going .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work on , i have to get up every day , and sweat , <unk> me and really awkward .
but even in my <unk> , sometimes , i &apos;ve got this thing .
and i guess that many of you have done this .
i had a work or ideas that made out of a source of me , which i can &apos;t actually identify .
what &apos;s this thing ?
and how do we have to lose in relationship with it without the opposite of our minds , but we can even believe in mental health ?
for me , the best life of how to create this , the best of the <unk> tom <unk> , i was interviewing him for a couple of years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this issue . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the <unk> creative <unk> that were in to master and with them with them .
but then he got older and down . he told me that he was going to go on a freeway on a freeway , and there it changed it .
he was driving at <unk> , when he suddenly hear a tune of a tune , which is it &apos;s hard to make it <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> . but he can &apos;t believe it .
he didn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so he starts to get this old <unk> in the way , like <unk> , i will lose this thing and will be registered by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of getting in panic , it just stopped .
he was finishing the whole of thought , and did something completely new .
and he just looked at the sky and said , sorry , can you see that i drive a car ?
<unk> <unk> i see so like i could just put a song ?
if you really want to do that , come back to a <unk> moment , if i can take care of you .
if not , you know , somebody else &apos;s another .
go and <unk> leonard cohen cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed after that .
not the work itself , and that was also as dark as it was as dark as ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds it was , it was <unk> , it was , where he was doing nothing as trouble , and then he got it to sort of <unk> , <unk> thing .
it was a <unk> , miraculous , weird collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , physical thing , which is not very tom .
and when i heard this story , it changed a little bit of how i worked and it would have saved me .
this idea , i saved me back in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , i fell in one of these specimens that we all the , if we &apos;re doing something and it doesn &apos;t work . it &apos;s a the worst book ever written .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project .
but then i remember how tom was talking to the free sky , and i tried it .
so i started to take my view from the manuscript and i spoke to a blank corner of the room .
i was talking to , <unk> listen , you know , and i know both , if this book is not very brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i &apos;ve invested all , i &apos;ve invested , i &apos;m investing in . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to show up here and your core of the deal .
ok . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the heck of the heck .
i &apos;ll still write that , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you the record , i &apos;m here for my part of the jobs today .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like follows , in centuries , in the desert <unk> people to <unk> with holy dances and music , who were <unk> and the week of the week of the .
and that strong was always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rarely , something special happened , and one of the performers was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you all of their life in their lives have seen this performance .
it was like , the time , and the dancers of a kind of <unk> , and he did not a different than he did ever before -- 1,000 nights before . but all the time together .
and all of a sudden he appeared in human .
it was bright off the inside , and down , and all the <unk> fires by a <unk> fire .
and so something that happened , the people knew what was that , they called it in his name .
they put together together and they started singing , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting <unk> : when the <unk> came to conquer these practice , and the pronunciation changed the over the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who you still hear about <unk> and <unk> .
if a filmmaker in spain something that was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> view of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , the tricky part of the next morning , when the dancers wakes himself wakes up and realize that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a <unk> of god in her .
it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> <unk> with a knee knee , and maybe he will never rise to the altitudes .
and maybe you may never name god &apos;s name if he &apos;s about . but what &apos;s he going to start with the rest of his life ?
it &apos;s hard .
that &apos;s one of the most <unk> correction , a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most exceptional aspects of their existence of them came from .
if you just think they &apos;re a loan to be a loan -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> period of your life that &apos;s passed on to someone else when they &apos;re ready .
and if we start thinking about this , it changes all .
so i started thinking about , and i think , in the last months , while i worked on the book , and it &apos;s been the dangerous , frightening , cut-off anticipated from my <unk> .
what i &apos;m constantly saying to say , if i &apos;m going to be crazy , is not afraid .
not <unk> .
just make your job .
is still going to be on your contributions to whatever it is .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the nagging divine genius , which is to you to the page , decides to a brief moment a proxy to a brief approach to a brief approach to a brief approach to <unk> <unk> !
and if not , dance , the dance , though .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , and that &apos;s all of you .
i believe that , and i feel that , and i should teach it .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , for sure , just for you , just for the mere human love and the <unk> , it &apos;s going to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , who had the the arctic , for nearly three million years , the size of the lower 48 states has shrunk to 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t really be very enough to the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic , the the the heavy heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in winter and the <unk> in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a <unk> <unk> what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is covered with red .
as you see , it grows on the <unk> , which is the year of ice in winter ; and it &apos;s the summer summer .
this so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone .
this is a problem because the warming has remained the bottom of the arctic ocean , where there are large quantities of hydrogen , which is , when it &apos;s going to <unk> from microbes from microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of embodied materials in the atmosphere , it could double double double in the time we cross that critical period .
today , today , in a few of the dark lakes in alaska , methane from itself from the water .
professor walter walter university in alaska is with a another group of a <unk> lake last <unk> .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it be us .
and one is the reason that tremendous heat is heat from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume is substantially bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in the southwest greenland .
if you want to know how to go through the sea level , and you &apos;re putting it into the ocean .
these rivers are a very quickly .
the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest one on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that showed over a few <unk> of <unk> , is particularly powerful in the melt .
this is about 20 feet of <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , see , there were new lakes that were glaciers in front of years ago .
40 percent of all people on the world , half of their <unk> &apos;s <unk> from this .
in the andes , this is the <unk> of the city of these .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s going to <unk> the most water .
in california , a 40 percent reduction reduction in the sierra leone .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions of how they &apos;ve read them , are serious .
this <unk> in the world leads to a dramatic reduction in fire .
and the majority of all over the world has been really <unk> in a really unprecedented and unprecedented extent to a unprecedented degree .
so many of the last 30 years in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it &apos;s <unk> .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve been <unk> 70 million tons of co2 -- 25 million tons of tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent , west and the indian <unk> , where there are a a dramatic decline in the oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning from fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is most most most lethal problem .
the united states are one of the two largest <unk> , combined with china .
and the suggestion was to build a lot more <unk> .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were taken in the last few years , with some green alternative , which became suggested .
<unk> is a political struggle in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollar , to make clean charcoal , which is already a contradiction in itself .
this image reminded me to something .
and just around christmas , at home in my home in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
you saw it in the news .
this is in our entire country &apos;s <unk> american americas .
this was all about christmas .
one of the advertisement of the <unk> of the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> is a <unk> , happy fellow .
it &apos;s a <unk> and abundance in america , and it &apos;s helping to grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> is cleaner every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and they stay in the salaries and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the leader of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you a very clear to say , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has been in the lives .
this is one , a part of her .
in the <unk> , we see climate change as serious danger for our business .
so , we &apos;ve been put it to the supreme court system , spend a substantial <unk> to bring a <unk> on the way to the truth of coal .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells even well well .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s leave it to us .
<unk> coal , they &apos;ve heard a lot of them .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean .
and yet , the burning of the main reasons for the main public for global warming is the remarkable clean <unk> that you see here is everything .
look at it right , this is what &apos;s going to be clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge of homeland security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all connects that all together is our dependence upon the fuel as dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now , there &apos;s a bold , new solution to make us from this <unk> capacity .
<unk> america 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years .
a plan to make america back to work , make us safer and help us to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest , our dependence upon ancient , dirty fuels that are all our world to reduce .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment to create good job .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african <unk> , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come to go , go together . &quot;
we have to come far , and that &apos;s rapidly .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you to ask her childhood , when they played with <unk> .
while they realized how to turn out and <unk> , the <unk> , and then they actually learned to think about thinking and understand problems through understanding and changing the <unk> of the <unk> .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of our interaction with real objects -- with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues , i started to wonder , what if we could do the computers , which is -- if we could physically take computers , and they could assemble data ?
and this is so that we have to evolve for us to explore the answer and <unk> developed .
in short , a <unk> , is a interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move with the hand , you can see each other , you can pick their movements and you have a screen and a <unk> .
more importantly , are physically , so you can only be able to reach out how <unk> can reach out of hands and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the analog digital data .
and if these are tools to become physical and a awareness of their movements , and each other is to recognize each other , and the subtleties of our interactions with them , then we can start with the study of new and entertaining .
i start with some simple examples .
this is the <unk> of the <unk> , and if i go into a direction , it will play the video forward , and when i go into the other direction , it &apos;s backwards .
and these interactive portraits are going to be true .
so , when i put them up next , you &apos;re about interest .
if they &apos;re surrounded with it , you &apos;ll notice that , and can you find some nervous .
and they feel equally and push their movements and tilt .
so a very interesting implication of the interactions we we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like colors like to put out of the way you do this with the fluid .
in this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , and i can use it to pour paint in the middle of the middle where they &apos;re blended together .
if we exaggerate it , we can play a little bit .
there &apos;s also some kind of nice opportunities in education like languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we give people the people who could give the opportunity to make the fast and error and the results immediately .
here i am ... this is a series that i &apos;m making with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words that is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
and basically , every round of the <unk> is to be <unk> letters and while you try to make words , they &apos;ll put this in a dictionary .
then after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s going to mixed up and you have a new new opportunities and new possibilities .
thank you .
this is some kids who came up on a 2.0 of the media lab , and i could move them to try and try it out and i made a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications in this kind of applications that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; behavior words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s a few people who test it .
that &apos;s our youngest <unk> down there right .
it turns out that he wanted to stack up the <unk> .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s .
he can bring new characters in the scene by showing the <unk> of the table which is this character .
here it lets the sun .
the sun is about .
now he &apos;s catching a tractor in the scene .
the orange blew .
good work ! yes !
by using the <unk> , and they can put the characters , and they can interact with the characters .
... his own story .
hi !
it &apos;s a story with open and it can decide how it develops .
flying cat flying .
the last example of that i &apos;ve been time for that time , is a <unk> <unk> for <unk> , which we &apos;ve developed in the <unk> as a sound like <unk> , bass and drum .
each has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can put those notes into the sequence that can create in any pattern of any pattern .
and you put them a , just by just a <unk> <unk> .
there are the effects that you can change live , like reverberation and filter .
you put it with a particular tone and it &apos;s to to put it up .
and then the effects of the speed and volume that you use it on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start to put the <unk> in two <unk> , and that in a series , they &apos;re extending and add a little more of the voice .
now i put a <unk> on .
now i &apos;m going to do something more .
and now i plug the filter with the drums , so i can steer the effect .
i can speed the entire sequence , by putting the speed up to one or another direction .
and now , i plug the filter again with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can switch the sequence as it is .
and so , i don &apos;t have to plan them on the <unk> , but can improvise ; it &apos;s <unk> , or <unk> them .
and finally , i can <unk> the entire sequence by which i spread the <unk> on the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my <unk> is to develop new <unk> that fit better , like our brains and bodies work .
and i &apos;ve had time , i &apos;ve got a part of these new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the thought that i want to give you to the way that we &apos;re at the brink of the new generation of <unk> to interaction with digital media that are bringing information into our world which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m very pleased to talk about all of them .
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very excited to me that i am there .
yeah , so , what should be <unk> ?
i have to go back a little step , and that is a <unk> with modern molecular biology .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology and for the <unk> , and i &apos;ve started to know , because i &apos;ve been beginning to know , and it was particularly to do anything in studying what i learned in studying in studying .
that &apos;s my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i was just trying to make the matter , so that .
i think the molecular biology is now , so generally , is generally , biotechnology , all that you count , synthetic biology and so on .
crucially important is now extremely important , now , is much , much more important in the future .
there &apos;s such a way of these things like this all genetically engineered plants on the <unk> .
there &apos;s craig venter in the <unk> who tries to make <unk> gas .
and then there &apos;s also things that are in the everyday life , which most people are not aware of the , for example , <unk> that allow us to wash with 40 degrees of laundry , is also genetically <unk> enzymes .
and the list can continue the pages .
and so from the interest in this , that &apos;s on this technology , i &apos;m on a further <unk> .
so what &apos;s now hacking ?
most people know most people know this from the <unk> .
computer <unk> , and then it becomes so , the hackers break into a place somewhere and the claws and so on .
that &apos;s kind of sad for the <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t even know what it actually actually started to actually what it &apos;s actually beginning .
and that &apos;s the <unk> , in the 1970s , <unk> with <unk> and it came to the internet .
and it &apos;s about a <unk> , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and the problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can just be a <unk> , which is how things you simplify things , so you can do it better or how can you do that better .
and it &apos;s just been stuff on software , but there &apos;s also the <unk> of the room , there &apos;s a whole <unk> of <unk> that make all kinds of things .
and now , just in the direction of biology , and i want to take this metaphor that i think of synthetic biology is actually a <unk> , because , the <unk> code is a more <unk> because , the <unk> code is a abstract code that &apos;s the same thing that is , and it &apos;s not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can program it and you can also hack it , so that , and that i find that i find incredibly fascinating , and i think i wanted to get a lot deeper into the time .
this actually actually actually <unk> eight to actually form , these networks .
there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which is the from the switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , but now , members of active people all over the world .
that &apos;s what &apos;s got a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s many artists and philosophers and and in collaboration with scientists with some scientists with these technologies and ask the creative , there &apos;s <unk> and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s really about the way to find a <unk> access to that kind of thing that we have to do .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> , which is actually a kind of a forum , where you can get and online .
now , the <unk> of <unk> and a little bit of <unk> on the way , and then , then , you know , you &apos;re asking .
and from this networks that made the whole popular , has a scene that would like to take a short question .
here &apos;s the image on the top left , which is a <unk> , so , basically a kind of school , so a private school , a private school , a non-profit group where anyone can be able to .
children , old , all kinds of people go to go through that , they put a laboratory in the lab and look at what can do when these <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a group in indonesia , which is called the , which is , but it &apos;s a pretty long time .
it &apos;s longer than these other parts .
and so , in such a artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also , <unk> , and combine it on pretty much more sophisticated way .
a group of ankara that i met in front of a while , which is a <unk> that would like to teach the public to what they learn in college , what they were learning in college and people tries to explain what is <unk> .
and i &apos;ve got a lecture on the top of a lecture in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s most of the most of young people , but the only thing what all comes together is this fascination with the technology .
and what you can do with it , and they just stuck in the society and to ask , okay , what you know what what you want to do , have their interest in doing this to bring you so to engage you ?
so , <unk> , to hack biology , you have some kind of material .
but you need to do biological materials , and you also need tools , and it &apos;s a laboratory tool , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
or what you &apos;re normally trying to understand a lab , which is such a <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely distance , <unk> academics trained <unk> , skilled <unk> academics with <unk> and so on .
and our approach was just to say , <unk> , that actually don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every single one has a <unk> has actually developed up , the technology is when most of the most of the most of the most of , that is really like this .
and it &apos;s my premise with this premise , then brian <unk> in england tries to <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and then a <unk> , and , yes , and it &apos;s got to be bacteria .
so everyone , that &apos;s a flat <unk> <unk> that has left too long , even .
i &apos;ve tried this in my lab home , and i was trying to take a little bit , and i &apos;d put a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to make a <unk> , so <unk> , so <unk> <unk> , so much of the <unk> <unk> .
now this shouldn &apos;t be a joke now , but it &apos;s not a joke .
here &apos;s the way down here in the picture , so you &apos;re in <unk> , so a <unk> garage garage with all kinds of <unk> , which has put in college , a group in paris who &apos;s doing and pretty much to do this project .
and this is <unk> , which is the only mentioned , as a kind of <unk> principle for molecular biology .
and yeah , you know , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s where you &apos;re just by people who are doing to the back of the to large , so larger organizations that would have more <unk> in the form of the more sophisticated form .
but anyway , the approach that it can just stop and to be accessible .
the first project we did as an international group , we know , we know , we know , we know , as real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are always chatting and chatting and so .
and then , the <unk> website , the founder , and has said , we &apos;ve got to make sure now , and then , and then two of these things are organized , one in the <unk> , <unk> 10 , and just in the <unk> , in san francisco .
and , because it &apos;s also , that &apos;s what we want to do , what do we want to do what we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are our objective , what is our purposes , our basis ?
and then , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
so this was quite intuitive , so everyone has just so his desires , and that , and what it moves , you know , then .
and i think , i think , a good code .
and we then have it compulsory , but that &apos;s , i think there &apos;s been relatively good at the people who are right on so .
and we actually tried to do that , again , the academic world , but there &apos;s not so it &apos;s kind of it .
so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> in the way , even one step further than the academia .
yeah , what do we do for projects now we actually do ?
a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland , was that we have an <unk> optical optical adhesive .
that &apos;s when you &apos;re focused on a laser , on a room , you can generate small particles in the air or in the liquid and then you &apos;re in this focus , so that &apos;s the way that as a <unk> of principle in principle .
this is really working on the academic <unk> , and we thought , <unk> , we might have , then we have a webcam , the jill , the lens , <unk> , the lens , <unk> , the lens , <unk> , it &apos;s blown up a microscope .
that &apos;s what you see down there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> the laser and then tries to focus on this camera .
and it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of that .
so another project that &apos;s from from the french group of paris , which has come up , which is pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s so one that &apos;s such a <unk> , so <unk> , so it &apos;s got to be busy with a <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he &apos;s got this this helmet , and in the cooperation with the museum .
and there were the visitors in the room , sitting in the place , sit on the helmet .
and then their brainwaves were measured , and the after what you thought or how they thought , is then different lights in the room .
it was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which is also to do with this <unk> , is the <unk> , which is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copy genes , to multiply , <unk> particles , to multiply them so that you can make it visible .
so if i do that , if i do that , the <unk> of the scene , and then , then , collect any <unk> , and then they do that turn that , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair belongs to this man , so .
and the machines that make things like this , they are pretty expensive to buy commercial , the cheapest , the world &apos;s getting to get out of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just a application of many , which can do it .
and they have two towers two towers , two builder , and they said , that &apos;s how we make and cheaper , and then we &apos;re open up open source , so we &apos;re <unk> , and then they &apos;re now to get into <unk> available , and now the cheapest are the cheapest implements from these devices .
i think , like six hundred dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a position where it &apos;s going to be more available .
so , it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project that i started to do in the beginning was a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , which is a <unk> , or two inches or so .
you add <unk> on <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> into these <unk> , and then i &apos;ve taken the <unk> <unk> and then i &apos;ve got it to the light .
so the device that you see there is not going to work .
but this is so my prototype my prototype , which is pretty funky , and that thing on , and it on , and it was attached to the pressure , and it was the pressure ceremony , and it &apos;s been the pressure ceremony , and it &apos;s been the pressure .
and then i took a <unk> scan , and it &apos;s attached to it .
a <unk> , if you get the full of water , so that &apos;s enough pressure , so i think , you know , 40 up the bar , you know , you know , you know , the <unk> bar .
and so , you can put the particles down too enough and then they go into the onion .
and the commercial machine costs about <unk> euros up , or something like that , <unk> the way to fifty .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so , that &apos;s the moment that is the <unk> of the scene , that &apos;s the availability of technology and also the information and the <unk> that more people can get there .
because , as the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have been relatively little idea of it and also not a chance to make it really well .
because , if you &apos;re just reading about it , it &apos;s not the same thing as if you &apos;ve done it yourself or has seen it once .
and i think technology is always going to be more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make a lot of a good decisions in society , and can make people , then you need access to know , and technology .
and you have to do it , and you can understand it and understand it .
and the <unk> <unk> under the <unk> open and citizen science .
so that just as citizens , you will be able to be able to be able to be able to be through this scientific technology .
and that &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who &apos;ve been officially on the website , <unk> website .
that &apos;s a relatively substantial number of people around the world .
and interestingly , and interesting is also , they are in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think is there are fewer people being registered in fact , as actually .
so i know some of you who don &apos;t put themselves .
and that &apos;s just the <unk> , the individual people .
and in part of these <unk> , so they put these places together .
and that &apos;s a very beginning .
like , <unk> has it just started .
and <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> , the world are represented in the world .
and we hope that we &apos;re going to take us , and then , and then they &apos;re also similar to be a lot of good , so that would be more of being involved in the way .
and i would invite everyone to address and even after what to try .
now it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible to do if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , you get there too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hi .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that &apos;s really moved as a designer , but also in the field of <unk> and in the field of <unk> and in front of all things in the field of user .
and there &apos;s how to put people in interactive media so that you can use this interactive media and to create it a very specific experience .
and i think that the interactive media in us are <unk> , cognitive models , the the paradigm that has been <unk> in our biological mind , very long time , and that we just can now be <unk> by interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that this <unk> that is that you &apos;re in there is actually going to get a place in the future , but actually it &apos;s like the future is that the future is right in us , in our <unk> roots .
what are now <unk> models ?
i &apos;ve been writing four <unk> , and i &apos;d like to explain to a minute .
so to <unk> cognitive models , and that is the models that we &apos;ve been in the pre-industrial times .
and to these <unk> models , that we &apos;ve basically been a natural relationship to that .
it &apos;s basically unusual to this kind of thing .
but i &apos;m going to go back to the second and and i &apos;ll prove to try and prove it is a natural relationship to that .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been able to be able to talk about this because of these <unk> models , which we &apos;ve been able to talk very , very , very , although we &apos;re using a <unk> language .
and the third section , which explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media has been <unk> by definition , which is the basic denial of the linearity and what tells us that we are the linearity today as normal .
the fourth thing is that the story is a place for us .
now , how is it now with with the field that is actually the most most most most most most most most most most most most most most most most most most most most most most is the world .
i want to to see that for you .
how many doors have the house , where you live ?
that won &apos;t we immediately answer to me immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen and is happening right now .
they &apos;re going to go through the spirit of this house , in <unk> , and look at how many doors there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they &apos;re <unk> the reality , and it &apos;s a very without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and there &apos;s a little bit of the <unk> for example that we &apos;re doing virtual reality in our <unk> , and we can actually show that all the time .
and that this applies to the virtual reality of the , which is actually the the very popular times of the pre-industrial times , because they didn &apos;t even have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing that had was her head .
and in this head , the memory was going off .
in this head , knowledge and using these virtual images , the imagination , were being passed on .
and so that &apos;s why it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with this .
the interesting thing about that , if i can make a little trip to a quick trip .
yeah , that &apos;s about .
the interesting thing about that is that at that time , the human time was <unk> and a media .
now , if you &apos;re thinking about a little bit of the .
what are media today ?
and then you &apos;ll notice that there has a change .
but i &apos;ll go to talk to the same .
the most fundamental tool of <unk> have been the most about stories .
<unk> , priests , so-called <unk> , were forced to turn to their own , to keep knowledge of stories .
and also , we &apos;re very very , very strong to stories .
the author of the book of the <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we &apos;ve been told a year <unk> hours with the <unk> of stories .
that means for a child , which is to reach the for the most of the time of the most of the time of the most of the time of the most of the time of the most of the time .
now we think we think our love is to stories is that we sat as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , the ones .
that &apos;s a lot more further back in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the field of interactive media , as particularly impressive is that we have to have a se in our biological memory , the ability to think of the <unk> .
i brought to give you an example of the north american tribe , the <unk> .
and the lives lived in the u.n. of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very <unk> area , and you have to be able to navigate , from an island to get food .
and they did this with something called <unk> .
you may know , if you &apos;re a little bit about the australian world .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a <unk> , but they used to use the same <unk> <unk> or also <unk> .
and what the interesting thing is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be mapped on the <unk> .
and the language was observatory of the <unk> of <unk> .
that means you &apos;re talking about sound and rhythm .
and these sounds and these match , the geology , the topography of a region , and it enables you to put these songs and to put together and out and left out to the left , and then they could go back to the back of the site and also get back to the back .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s what &apos;s happening ?
and it &apos;s what happens is that <unk> age .
we &apos;ve got in the same thing called the <unk> .
and it &apos;s going to be the age of aging and is the book and is that &apos;s the <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the production of our individual memories of their individual memories of their own .
it &apos;s on the book and the image .
so , unfortunately , we &apos;ve been a <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
now , that &apos;s suddenly <unk> <unk> to us , and has to do anything more .
bruce brown , a famous <unk> on the <unk> , is so far to say that this mass media , he &apos;s the book and the image , so that &apos;s not the tv , which is that these mass mass mass of our memory would have been depleted and our have our capacity to <unk> <unk> .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the machine machine .
what does influence on our thinking and on our thinking and our <unk> ?
and then the most fundamental community are the pre-industrial culture .
and the are over the course of the centuries , more and more medals of <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> .
that &apos;s what instead of individually is , we have standardized , widespread , masses , masses of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we &apos;re not producing more ourselves .
we have a abstract language language .
we don &apos;t think about the things that anymore in images , but we <unk> them our language .
we &apos;ve got to that things happen .
and we have the linearity and law , and there are no exceptions , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s left us is the <unk> .
still , we &apos;re very arrested at the <unk> as a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
the question is , what is coming ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had this machine age , and we &apos;re going to go to the so-called <unk> .
this sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very , very science science , i know .
but these concepts of the <unk> , that bring us to discover these opportunities back back to our own capabilities .
there &apos;s mount . it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain this a little bit of explaining a little bit .
there are technical concepts like , like the dotted reality , which is the augmented reality .
so if you look at google , for example , you &apos;re looking at the concept of what we &apos;re going to combine the virtual world with the real world that is called our <unk> to <unk> that &apos;s virtual as something that is natural , which is natural to feel , again .
another example is that what is called virtual reality .
so crazy , of course , as you know , this is a kind of thing in the context of my presentation , because we &apos;re moving ourselves physically in not <unk> , virtual worlds , very looking at the model of the <unk> .
and another example is the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human people .
all that needs the ability to accept our basic capacity to accept extrinsic .
i &apos;ve been in the degree and i hope that works a very , very beautiful project with me , that is the <unk> <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two are also , there are here today .
maybe you can get up to you , so that they can stay in the recess with the two and entertain the same project .
and this project , i brought to the one , and i brought up with this <unk> , cognitive models .
so this whole thing is a game , i have to say to say .
which is actually extremely <unk> , of course , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say , you know , you know , you know , you know , any people before some <unk> <unk> or <unk> that they play with with some of some <unk> in the hand .
and in case , they &apos;re doing that in it .
that &apos;s a game for outside .
and that &apos;s what i think is that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game is combining the virtual world , so the data that we produce , with the real world .
i &apos;m sorry to be so much .
you can explain that much better , there &apos;s more than more behind it .
and that &apos;s what i discover a city , looking at which places , positive or negative <unk> .
and so i get one of the city to a different sight , and a whole different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city and get this way to this way , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can like to look at a look at a look at .
oh , what you can see is , is another little explanation of what you see right .
of course , this virtual world has been in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a way , we can see these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to wrap this to be my my talk and in the sense that the qualities and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s actually not going back to our roots back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be very , to be in to you .
i &apos;ve been asked to be if this bag was there a bag of <unk> bag and i &apos;d be talking about .
it won &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m going to fail to be a bit of what &apos;s inside .
but before i &apos;m doing it , i &apos;m just curious about it .
yes , children are being in being curious about being curious , or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so , of course , i &apos;m also concerned with the subject of curiosity and how changed the curiosity that we think , and why don &apos;t we have to keep the curiosity and so on it and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with a lot of a work .
when professors were curious , they &apos;re going to be a lot like like , <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half a year .
a <unk> to the subject of natural design interface .
now you &apos;re asking , why begins the whole of the designers to do with this , <unk> <unk> of communication , etc and so on .
and there &apos;s just one of these little devices , because the things should always more intuitive , and it &apos;s more intuitive , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually <unk> for us , of course , which is <unk> or intuitive .
and before the background i have to do in the domain of the , so the next generation of the human computer is to work with the relationship of human being , in the relationship of human being , how our computer was to change the computer &apos;s license in the digital wizards .
so i &apos;m busy with this , when of course , or intuitively , intuitive .
maybe again , a look at it .
why is that happening ?
so if we look at a society , we &apos;re looking at this , in a nutshell , we &apos;re now starting from the third <unk> or <unk> .
so from the modern in the <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
the beginning the <unk> through language .
that &apos;s called , you know , that you &apos;ve talked a common language language , you could communicate with each other , is in the same cave , or in other areas , has cities or villages or villages , and he &apos;s created by <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> , but something very natural , a very a very natural thing .
and you also had to learn to learn , so a toddler can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it and all of course .
and then , then , they will give them through the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
that was a <unk> , because , of course , the living language in the form of writing , which is what <unk> and alive , and then , and i &apos;ll put it in stone and so i dove in stone .
the after i &apos;m <unk> and when i <unk> , it &apos;s a very different story than when there are a living in life .
but then , then , then , that typeface was a <unk> , received .
and then the next generation came to , in which we actually actually live in life today .
that &apos;s just the <unk> by pressure and <unk> typography with <unk> and others .
at the time , it was the same <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and others said , are you actually excellent , when the people want to read , then you want to join the people who are completely <unk> .
and now we come into the next generation and the exciting generation , and a <unk> is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re actually really in the moment in this stage stage that we &apos;re doing that .
and the confused of course , is really , because we &apos;re seeing one side of the new media , social media , facebook and and so on .
with the complete transparency , what the new thinking is , you know , in the old , don &apos;t tell that in the <unk> <unk> and no beef is more or other phenomena , which is that i want to do that just <unk> and want to do it .
and these two worlds , pop , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing is , if you &apos;re the guy , this new society , these <unk> , <unk> very large , very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> the <unk> .
now , not more at the local level , but it &apos;s a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that &apos;s a global ecology of ecology .
not if i think locally here , the neighbor thinks less green , it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
that is , from local village , actually , a global village has become a very same principles , of course , very intuitive , but also the total transparency .
so , as you were in in the village , who has what to whom and when , who , when , what happens to whom , and that is what happens to this expansion of our self through this mobile <unk> on global level .
it &apos;s that we know globally , and it &apos;s getting better and better .
as it used to be on the village after the village .
i just started to see a look at this , which is what it &apos;s called , what we &apos;re going to do is , of course , what we might also have <unk> , which is what makes the difference ?
because often , people get people , can &apos;t make it <unk> , so everyone can handle it .
so you have to do with this , which is because it &apos;s not just changing it , it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
and when of course , something is something , and how can i take influence on the influence and so things that they shape , so they &apos;re a <unk> , so very intuitive , so very intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re just to use .
you know , you know , well , as a student , with the topic of perception and the <unk> .
and that &apos;s of course , what you start and look like , and you say , okay , now i just look into the inside itself .
and what &apos;s it looks like it ?
so how do we work if we were ?
and what does mean , of course , intuitively , intuitive and how do our kind of work and how does the cognitive function does ?
because steve jobs has said you to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
so you really have to look at the detail detail , if i want to make something like a little bit of intuitive <unk> , which is the core .
and there you see , a our seven senses , most of us , we &apos;ve only been five , now , there &apos;s probably seven <unk> , there &apos;s probably the next future , there &apos;s still the next to the point of the time , and as an extension of our self .
and to see how process we process information , how do we take information ?
in their own , what &apos;s information ?
information is every difference that is a difference .
many use the word , but not even not what it means to all open .
but i have to understand in the core , in the understanding of what is going to understand from information , when will get information information and from information , so i know how i can do things like intuitive or intuitive or or or <unk> .
and of course , as embracing design influence on perception .
we see this , if i do things , i can make you <unk> like on the right , which is salt and pepper , or i can sort of intuitive design , by showing things .
so , very much natural , in a gourd , but i see right where it &apos;s salt and pepper and pepper .
and if i say someone , you give me salt or pepper , you &apos;ll think about where is what &apos;s inside .
and the left simply , access , and then hopefully , hopefully that no sugar is in there , the salt is that salt .
but also our perception itself , how does you think is how powerful you can us .
for example , this perception of context .
the right circle is a greater than the small , although it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just equal to the same , and yet our perception is changing , and the context we are doing things .
does anyone know what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should work .
there &apos;s been there , i think about the glasses of the glasses .
so it &apos;s &apos; n .
a second circle starts to relate to feel like .
and if i &apos;m going to take a <unk> <unk> , and then we &apos;re not just one more unit , which is a circle , and we see a unit , we &apos;re not going to see a circle , a circle , a circle , another one .
it &apos;s called <unk> or <unk> , which is also influenced us in perception .
and for the , the most of the designers that have most of the most semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> , the continuity and so on .
often , in the third time , forget .
but that &apos;s essential important to be an essential important to do things so that &apos;s a intuitive thing to do .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting is that &apos;s looking at .
now , it sounds very trivial , but so interesting when you &apos;re busy in that .
so we have the eyes and now think , we think we &apos;re looking at the front of the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see , then at the back of it .
and that &apos;s a presumption , a presumption , you see something you can recognize , <unk> circle .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at is , we see , before we see it back to the back in the back of our <unk> , to say , okay , okay .
i mean , i have a cognitive <unk> , you have what you want to see .
that &apos;s then there , that &apos;s coming back again .
and then it goes back to the front because the back of the back , and then , now , now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you see , what you see , you know , what you want to see .
and then it goes back to back and then it &apos;s actually going to be seen .
so , a whole , very <unk> process , how things are doing and what &apos;s going to happen to the difference of these things .
i don &apos;t know who knows who you know from you .
and there &apos;s exactly what happens exactly what i described just about .
now , everyone &apos;s trying to recognize something out of this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who knows what you recognize .
does someone else ?
a <unk> , right .
if i saw that once , that there is a <unk> in there , you know that .
they will never forget about it , because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and further , you see it always .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve actually <unk> is that they didn &apos;t have no pattern of <unk> , but i &apos;ve got them in a very short time , and over again , this dog in this <unk> image .
and this is this projection of looking at , you see , see .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m now doing the <unk> of the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes , which then , yes , gray is actually , but here &apos;s actually not , but here in this <unk> crowd are just smooth .
does anyone know what three seconds ?
for , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know what designers .
if i know , something takes three seconds to sort of a little bit of the present , and i can <unk> <unk> that i &apos;m doing with a <unk> <unk> that i &apos;m always going to do with three seconds .
it &apos;s just to process that as a present .
and then it moves into the past , and so i can bridge very elegantly <unk> , for example , if i know this phenomena .
what does <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
and a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you fall in love .
that means if you know that , you know , who you look at who you look like long because i don &apos;t have any <unk> for what &apos;s going to happen to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of most abstract that we have .
that &apos;s what this first is is going to be in a rapidly rapid speed , as we perceive things .
and as we can see things , what we &apos;re looking for , and how we are in our environment , to protect it accordingly .
now , of course , designers don &apos;t think about the subject of perceptions and neural <unk> or <unk> , but primarily of course , with the subject of the <unk> .
so , as a human being is so accordingly .
there &apos;s a very <unk> of the practical , so things like this kind of gnarly things .
there are <unk> , where i know exactly where to reach out .
but there are symbolic features , why gives someone to do a little <unk> , where anything is <unk> , so much of the <unk> of money on the money , so it &apos;s not so practical ?
there we are more on the <unk> , on the <unk> of which we also think of course , of course .
back to my real subject of natural and the subject , which is of course , is <unk> .
<unk> means , as i can achieve a certain goal , or how can a user in a particular brain system , as effective , efficiently and <unk> a destination .
that &apos;s what &apos;s the norm .
how can i make something like a <unk> ?
can i do that directly , or i need to be the manual manual or i &apos;m a <unk> training for it .
and less <unk> or <unk> .
that i &apos;m just designing it , and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
that &apos;s what you have to understand .
and if you &apos;re in part of the software that we &apos;ve just seen , and you can understand why <unk> percent of our today &apos;s software is not <unk> or not to harness the <unk> of the things that is more intuitive than traditional software .
but it &apos;s not a intuitive <unk> for apple to have a fundamental <unk> , <unk> of elementary , if i can use technology devices that people might make .
why ?
because in the rule , we &apos;re in the way that we are , of the natural user , for example , for example , five times times are on average .
you have to imagine that if you do something about the classical <unk> , and five hours , and with this new kind of new software , just an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean , you probably get four hours more likely to go home , but you can get to employers or anybody , you know how to do it with the four hours of it .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a corresponding thing to do with some of the things that is .
and then , if we put together in the field of software , here &apos;s the first <unk> line of interfaces that were very abstract where they &apos;ve taken months to deal with these systems .
then the next one came to the next , now with a <unk> business or mental model like the software <unk> , which is , you have a notion of something that is the metaphor that make the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
so , not more zeroes and ones or <unk> code , but just a metaphor .
so that did this whole thing for this whole , but it &apos;s also a lot of much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works very much more with behavior .
so , i &apos;m designing a lot more more than what behavior looks like this .
that &apos;s a paradigm shift .
that i think that &apos;s a lot of the <unk> for success , just the <unk> of app .
and if i &apos;m going to step into this step in these natural user interfaces , where i share with voice , by language , by <unk> , by gesture , by gesture , by gesture , by gesture , and <unk> the things that i &apos;m going to drive , and then , is still going to go ahead and on one .
but that leads me to the point , again , when will the things are more intuitive ?
if it &apos;s intuitive , and then i have to have my little friend here and look at what &apos;s the only thing that is in view of the <unk> , when is now something that intuitively ?
and that &apos;s always something for us , and that &apos;s a little intuitive , if i have to think about it &apos;s a little bit about it .
so he doesn &apos;t seem to think about it , but it just just do it .
the less i kind of thinking about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does this mean for the designers ?
that is , if we look at a existing basis of using existing data from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can do this used to use this as a designer .
that means , i can transfer an intuitive , human <unk> on software into software and so that software is a major <unk> .
now , of course , the question is , what is the <unk> <unk> of us and now i &apos;ve ever tell it .
this is what called <unk> .
that &apos;s using all of us and <unk> is an acronym and it stands for , you know , <unk> , <unk> .
and that &apos;s what everybody of you all of you , but it &apos;s unconscious and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or partly instinctive .
the model is going to be in the womb and is <unk> , so it works in the world &apos;s young and old , and it &apos;s been used for us all the time without that most of the time we knew that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> is about 50 to <unk> times of the activity of the activity , so in the sleep , you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s less often <unk> than the day .
i can now control this mental <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
and by this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the design , now , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and that &apos;s on a higher grail of the <unk> , as the <unk> of a classical metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i &apos;m going to <unk> that , for example , in the , when i &apos;m going to pass through the <unk> of the , <unk> as a choice , it &apos;s going to go to me , and you &apos;re going to buy it or shopping or shop and whatever , and go shopping or shop and so on .
and then i can transfer this whole .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a <unk> .
i &apos;ve just eaten cake .
now , it &apos;s now interacting with the object , i can do with the object , <unk> , <unk> .
i get the whole overview of this , can be filter and can say , show me all the thing with chocolate .
and one is a one , which is more intuitive and much more natural .
because , i can reach the things like the pair , and it comes to me , is much more natural than if about <unk> organized web pages or other kinds of mechanisms to sort of these things available .
imagination is more <unk> <unk> , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to close to a and let &apos;s give the evidence of the time to come up to new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much very much for your attention .
i want to give you to a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , if you &apos;re going to be big , as a child , is that they care about what they did that , you know , and the after that their parents allowed to play more or less in the <unk> , the more , and so , in the way , is , in the way , is that in the <unk> , and then
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t make .
so , all of these are , and curious are , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
and i &apos;m now about this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years , <unk> , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point in it .
and it &apos;s about phosphorus .
<unk> a chance .
every day they give up a minute , they give them to order to two grams of phosphorus , and every day , they have to have to two grams of phosphorus .
you don &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
they can &apos;t have bone .
we could just glide as a <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t have any phosphorus , and they do .
so , what &apos;s really , is that we &apos;re doing something that we &apos;re doing with something which is <unk> , but not that &apos;s not that .
because all talk about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the <unk> .
the <unk> is a lot more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve got phosphorus , for two years , and now , through the <unk> world , much more uranium in the world &apos;s much more affordable in the environment than being used in all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years , <unk> tons of corn has been distributed in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take all .
it &apos;s <unk> leukemia .
and we think we would protect the environment , if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , the the environment , get less car .
<unk> , the environment , make less waste .
<unk> , the environment , <unk> less energy .
but it &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s like , as if i say , <unk> your child , it would just blow it three times than five times .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if we think about the <unk> to the <unk> , our our earth used to be our entire earth sooner or later a <unk> .
and that &apos;s just about the <unk> to think of the <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as the first thing .
the ground is a <unk> of <unk> percent of the <unk> .
and at the moment , we &apos;re building corn and 30 kilograms of 30 tons of 30 tons of 30 acres or on the square meter .
that means we lose , about five thousand times more , more than new educated .
we can actually look at the <unk> of the world .
and everything is yes or content .
in <unk> , for example , the <unk> 20 percent of the <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
and because we get older , they will be <unk> .
that &apos;s a way they &apos;re all in the <unk> .
yes ?
a baby needs out of <unk> <unk> .
we could actually reduce that 10 percent , but what does that power ?
this is in a second .
it &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with this <unk> ?
here &apos;s one of the proof that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be on the <unk> pigs .
in the urine , the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s that that is , right ?
traditionally , we think we think in the <unk> of the world , we &apos;re too many of the world .
and if you &apos;re the people who are <unk> , if you say that it would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re going to be <unk> and hostile .
and so , someone like al gore , one of our big heroes , there &apos;s nothing more than the human population .
in israel , you know , if you &apos;re a human <unk> , you &apos;ll give the earth .
here &apos;s what you say , the more you get more <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , we &apos;re really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on the earth , then weigh the ants just about four times more than we humans .
i could take as as as as as as as in the u.s. like no , as well , as far as they were vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh a lot more than we .
and because it &apos;s physically harder than we and because they &apos;re just three to six months , they &apos;re in your weight , the energy consumption will be 30 billion people .
that is , we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
and where you see how far we are gone away , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , we can see that , for example , that example , you &apos;d like to have a program to 20 40 40 40 40 , you &apos;d like to be here , right ?
they can only be <unk> , if they don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you ever seen a <unk> tree again ?
yes ?
one ?
that is , our whole intelligence means that we &apos;re going to be a trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
thankfully , not , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> in trees .
there are still a hundred billion trees in the agricultural world .
now , you &apos;ve heard something about <unk> of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be a trees as a trees .
and where you see , even as demeter , the <unk> <unk> agriculture , not allowed our own <unk> .
every year we lose that three million tons of phosphorus that would actually be to go back into the dimensions .
and so we &apos;re too many .
on it alone .
that &apos;s so guilty of us as guilty of the earth that we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and how they all are the hot , the <unk> that allow our own <unk> .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be able to be less harmful to <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to have a large footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the big , not there , yes ?
<unk> , yes ?
they can only have <unk> if they &apos;re not there .
even if they &apos;d shooting at now , they would have emissions .
so they can &apos;t fix this .
we can different .
we can take our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing in brazil agriculture where we get rid of nutrients .
right now , we can be in this way nutrients in agriculture .
we do this in china for instance , where we take directly to the trash .
in china , a a <unk> today , a <unk> , sort of , yes ?
and in our western world we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that is , the entire western <unk> is coming out of the city , but the <unk> never have to have a year .
and so , in order to grow the cities , because the farmers went into the cities , and the cities had to keep keep keep going to keep their nutrients away .
so all of the western highs are always expanding , until they don &apos;t have done the infrastructure to the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a <unk> civilization over five thousand years because you always had the capacity to get rid of nutrients .
even today , if you invited to lunch , in china , you expect to eat that as long until they &apos;re going to see the restroom .
because it &apos;s <unk> <unk> to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to lunch , not to the <unk> .
that means , you can see the internet , you can see the nutrients back .
and this is really neat about , if you do that , so , it creates , it creates biogas , on a hectare of a thousand people in favelas , so that &apos;s a farmer to provide the chickens and chickens and chickens and vegetables and vegetables and herbs and the fish .
and the great thing is that the <unk> <unk> has moved in the favelas to over the <unk> .
so we don &apos;t need to control people to be bad at the very bad .
we can support them , well .
and that &apos;s natural , but the sanitation is themselves .
the polar byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed to design through design , which is a farmer can just manage it .
that &apos;s what you go back to the <unk> .
and none of these plants , we &apos;ve been built over <unk> over the last 20 years , none of these plants have ever been <unk> .
you could just be able to be a pint of a liter of <unk> and then it would be <unk> over years .
not a lot of time .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people to be bad at the very bad .
we can support them , well .
that means we need to be phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do , you know , you &apos;re going to write yourself in germany , to the best treatment treatment in the <unk> .
unfortunately , unfortunately , it &apos;s not in <unk> , but maybe you can do the <unk> <unk> for a little bit .
because the <unk> plant could be best to the phosphorus back .
and it &apos;s got to go back .
we see that &apos;s really critical .
and we see it &apos;s a good job .
we &apos;ve put in holland for three years now .
the dutch government explains , they will be the first country in the world , which is what &apos;s going to be <unk> .
but we need it all around .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are more competent countries that control 40 percent of the u.s.
and the oil will replace us by other energy .
but the phosphorus is not replace .
that &apos;s not about making the existing false slightly less , but it &apos;s about doing something right .
and it &apos;s particularly about questions , what the right thing is .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , you understand that , because in holland , the country on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if you have your wife , if you have your wife , if you have them , and they come and they come from the <unk> .
very inefficient .
but it &apos;s effective , and it &apos;s effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
so , in germany , about six <unk> three pounds of life in their lives .
in the way .
it &apos;s not not exactly exactly the time because because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to do it .
but a <unk> , even at that lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but very effective , but it &apos;s effective , right ?
a whole thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
because it &apos;s not efficiency efficiency , but efficiency .
so , what is the right ?
not , the <unk> <unk> gets a little bit better and <unk> and <unk> all the materials to the dimensions , but first to ask , it &apos;s first to ask , how do you get together ?
so , imagine mozart &apos;s efficient .
yes ?
if i go to dinner , and say , there &apos;s a pill with a <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , huh ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love in somebody , it ?
yes ?
that means , everything that matters is is not about saving to avoid , to avoid .
the whole <unk> .
we say people , oh , you don &apos;t have green green in the south .
no , it &apos;s just throwing the right thing , right ?
and every place where you &apos;re <unk> , you know , you &apos;re going to get <unk> .
but the wrong things .
if you put the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
we think of the north .
there &apos;s a footprint there .
if they run , yes , everybody footprint the ground .
because the ground is the ground , the mosses will die off and the water is blocked the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint , that &apos;s that the water remains longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about to create a large footprint that will be a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say in germany , sustainability .
yes ?
but if i ask you about how about it &apos;s like your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainably .
and then i say , <unk> <unk> , yeah ?
that &apos;s just the limit .
so not saving , apart .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a sense of looking at italy , like the people in the high bow , you get out of the car out there .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a <unk> form , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve developed a <unk> <unk> that is liquid temperature temperature .
they can <unk> them where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re going everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so that it &apos;s not going to generate diversity in diversity .
that is , we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so , it &apos;s two pieces together .
not all of course , it &apos;s not supposed to be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , which they use it just , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , how <unk> , who have to be so that they go into biological systems .
the things that are being used , are going to be used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
it &apos;s a direct ad , and not for the company in <unk> per se , but for that you &apos;re doing this company now to help this business .
because we don &apos;t do it anymore .
yes ?
so , if i say you to eat and say , it &apos;s free of <unk> , then it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we &apos;re hardwired to what it is in .
positive .
so , not like <unk> .
not toxic in in .
it &apos;s useful in it , it &apos;s useful .
that &apos;s the first pair of shoes that you can go to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the rubber into biopolymers , right ?
everything is <unk> of it .
and if it comes to us , of course , it &apos;s going to be for nike , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half all the world &apos;s most <unk> that will be caused by the textile industry .
and so they &apos;re helping you ask for people to ask for the people .
hey , <unk> , power are you really serious ?
because they &apos;ve already changed twice the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really <unk> them .
so , let me do a little bit about it .
but it &apos;s about .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown .
that &apos;s about .
we can make things now that they , if you &apos;re <unk> , you can put them into biological units .
so , the technology is just as .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> for this .
this is the first ecological <unk> , actually , that &apos;s made for the circulation .
so , that , in each store , you can get the things .
if you get that , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> of the <unk> ?
if the &apos;s right now is the waste .
all of those <unk> are <unk> , almost .
in the countries where people get to money .
there &apos;s the front jump in the front of the world , but it &apos;s like this in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we can change the <unk> , that they can actually go back to <unk> , you can see a baby in israel or tunisia , in tunisia , plants .
yes ?
just if they take these <unk> , they <unk> , sterile and the powder to plant trees .
so that &apos;s the baby <unk> for all life , right from the beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s sort of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yes , so , kind of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can go again .
i started to a institute .
now , many people working with and you can get involved in .
there &apos;s an extra club to be <unk> , where everyone can join .
so , not save , apart , avoid , not reduce , not a <unk> , but intelligent waste .
does it be like ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music as language .
and in the description of my talk is that i was as a <unk> , so as a <unk> , so , in the english , , i understand .
<unk> is spoken by the written notes in <unk> music .
that as a translator , not just <unk> word for text in a different language , but also have to understand the deeper sense of words and <unk> so that it makes a good translation knows to do it with <unk> .
i &apos;ve been translating in english to english , can &apos;t require more , because it &apos;s about poetry or to poetry or all about poetry .
but it &apos;s really alien , but what we do with our <unk> , and what we do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> of a <unk> , i just have the written notes .
you certainly think that the composer has exactly <unk> in the notes , which has dreamed of it .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
and those notes are about just as much as much as a verbal verbal , as a verbal <unk> , a a landscape description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the odor of the flowers doesn &apos;t smell the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , not to the <unk> , not to feel .
that is , the interpreter has to be this <unk> survey of the <unk> , in a different , which is <unk> , integrated <unk> .
today , i want to you that , which is to translate to the other musical , so , you know , in a verbal language .
so basically , in handy translation .
so , i prefer to do this to do this up to german , because if i had to translate into english , it would be to be able to translate to english , it would be synonymous for me to translate the translation of the translation .
so the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the <unk> notes have the function of a writing .
so it &apos;s not going to take a to read and to read the keys on the piano or the right place to a <unk> .
that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to do .
the letters tells you the letters that you can recognize the language .
and so you need to have to the learning process of music for for least as long as a spoken for spoken .
and there &apos;s also a <unk> of <unk> , whether it learns to be passively , or you can also be able to talk to the musical speaker .
the work of the <unk> starts like the one of the <unk> .
after all of the way you &apos;ve chosen to have a piece , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re excited to separate away from the formation of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in the <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or if there are words , thoughts of the composers themselves .
and you study the works that he &apos;d before and after after after .
you can compare .
the <unk> , to write it .
how what does it feel like ?
how were the circumstances of the world , like the society and the politics ?
that &apos;s all interested in me .
you think in this time , by looking at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
but with time , but in the time , but as an interpreter , the <unk> of the <unk> , to take a lot of times , and it &apos;s easier easier to feel in it and feel like it .
the composer is always going to be more to a friend who live together .
his cause to write the piece , is always going to be more and more and more and more and more and more and more of play .
now , the notes all the other than a direct record of the composers , but just a framework , i now make this framework to to make it back with meaning and meaning to meaning .
i &apos;m saying to my own words , which is written between that framework .
i &apos;m playing <unk> , which could be these sound .
now for me , and for the composers , and what they might mean for him today .
each note , every phrase gets a sense , because i feel it , because it comes from my now personally personally .
it &apos;s got to be in here and now , and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience to that the cause my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , when i can have the experience that i &apos;ve got to have been doing in advance of the way to experience .
as you &apos;re still talking a happy day , although the same rituals of life , get their <unk> , to work , and the same thing i still get the same thing again .
i have become a day older , the seasons is coming down , my pulse is going to slow down to a morning , it takes longer that the sound of coming back back home .
i &apos;ll take the breath of the audience or <unk> or <unk> .
all of that affects me and all of that affects my experience with the composition .
it &apos;s wonderful , though , when i &apos;m a <unk> on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
and then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea in and and it will be that answers to a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have so much , and what you can &apos;t have to do so .
it &apos;s great fun to do this way , and you as the audience , you know , as the audience is communicated .
so every concert is another concert .
i will never play more like this .
i can &apos;t play in this way in 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more <unk> , more <unk> , emotions and emotion than today .
sure , i &apos;ll also have <unk> some <unk> , but for new <unk> .
so , i have a nice example of this .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> in my beloved <unk> , professor <unk> , a famous <unk> , <unk> and <unk> professor of the <unk> in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was too young to a young , so he was a <unk> , and i finally started studying .
but i had this great fortune , very early to meet it , early years ago , and so i was in my high school on the classes .
i was at the time 17 , when i was going to participate in a class , and the last one of the four favorite of the chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this was going to me for me .
that &apos;s such a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
and he said , he said , &quot;
that &apos;s got to be the <unk> .
because for me , you know , it means .
he was about 60 .
well , in 17 , you are still dreams , but not a major memories of the .
i &apos;m going to play this this for me today , and it &apos;s been out for me , although it &apos;s not changed for me .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because i &apos;ll read something new .
an example of a whole range , monet has painted the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always a garden , but to different <unk> , with light light .
he &apos;s translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , as it looks like it in this moment .
his personal <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is like this .
now , i &apos;m also also older than the chopin of <unk> , when he wrote the piece .
he lived in a <unk> years .
and it &apos;s important to me , and i think , even in the notes , even if i mean you can draw .
to hold <unk> , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only link to him .
especially if it has died .
now , how do you start to talk about the language of music ?
i said yes , you have to have about the same way for spoken to spoken .
often , the <unk> is so that you learn to read the reading .
you learn basically , to read it before you just talk a word .
you learn to find notes to the notes on the instrument .
and then , if all the fingers in time and pretty much as it &apos;s in the notes , then they &apos;re going notes out the way that sounds like this music .
if that &apos;s happening , the student gets the <unk> piece of the time .
it &apos;s hardly talking about interpretation of interpretation .
well , there &apos;s a little bit , there &apos;s a quick piece of play .
<unk> , slowly .
it &apos;s loud and <unk> , f and b , et .
that &apos;s what most of you here .
but even if you translate these data , it still still is technical technical .
and still , it &apos;s always not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder you &apos;re often losing a lot of the <unk> .
that is that , to make music on the instrument , make your musical do and feel about before .
and that &apos;s what singing .
a kid who didn &apos;t learn that , because it &apos;s not the parents , it won &apos;t be done by itself .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to have to have a more possibility to make it on a more instrument , so on a instrument .
people who never said that , and they never felt immediately with their body , like it is to form a sound .
one phrase with his own breath .
the instrument is that is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords of our hands , and they were dancing and dance .
so the <unk> of the piano is the sequel to my finger .
the tune comes from the <unk> and the rhythm of dance .
the <unk> <unk> today with music is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to do more than it &apos;s going to do it anymore if it &apos;s a bit boring .
no longer need to sing a whistling or sing a <unk> .
every music is going to be <unk> when you get constantly from the outside of music .
sure , there are certain among you who say yes , but what you do , if if i don &apos;t sing it ?
and i ask , you can &apos;t sing , a , because you believe they can &apos;t sing sing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learn to sing to sing ?
and it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out if they can &apos;t yet , or learn how to get these little muscles , which hire the little muscles that <unk> the chords of the chords .
and that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you &apos;re <unk> it , they &apos;re <unk> .
so , i wonder , how resourceful was that diagnosis ?
have you have a <unk> or <unk> , how to say it beautiful ?
or d , they don &apos;t like music and want to do not to do with it .
but what i would do , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also get them even more .
well , you know , you see , all of the time , no one has to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t say , don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
and i said , but certainly you can tell you , or not you like it .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s telling you , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s taste because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t get rid of the food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to be rid of classical music because they don &apos;t play a instrument .
listen to them and say if it tastes or not .
whether the music is to <unk> or sweet .
say that what they feel .
and then , with time , you get some more spices of <unk> or taste , you know , you know , there .
now , why am i challenge to my audience now that it &apos;s also active listening ?
because the music is a language and a language to communicate .
a piece of artwork that you can never look at is not a force .
the food that &apos;s eating by a chef or a chef , has to be eaten , and not only looked at them or join .
so listen to me if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice thing .
if in a environment where the adults are doing , or at least active music , a child , a child , it &apos;s very easy to a <unk> , to ask , what color has your flower ?
can you play me in blue ?
and the child is playing after a <unk> , instead of a red flower now .
and this sounds very different than before .
that was the first beginning of a musical expression , and we had a musical expression .
so the first step on a interpretation .
and what happens if you play a piece of today , which was originally a hundred , ago , or <unk> three hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments of the instruments .
there was no piano for time for the instrument , even a instrument .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think that it would have been excited about if he had the most powerful opportunity to have advanced modern energy .
i can now the <unk> that the bach has had to sound on the modern piano , which is a <unk> <unk> .
also , by beethoven knows he had gotten more than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that &apos;s a orchestra of that time has been <unk> .
so the composers are on ourselves on us to reinvent the pieces .
they &apos;re going to be up , which they &apos;ve dreamed of the spirit of it .
and also , what you would think about today in the spirit of mind .
or what i &apos;m doing is because what you could have thought of .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
were you <unk> ?
and how did that feel like ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a <unk> .
and when i come to my little v , and i &apos;m going to take a sense , comes out of this feeling .
i &apos;ll put something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need big car ?
that &apos;s actually , in the first year half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford to do this , like , &quot; a car ?
and then i immediately , it &apos;s <unk> .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice , that awkward sensation is that .
and our organism , we invented a great method to bring those inconvenient feelings like the way to go .
you can try that in words like revenge or <unk> or something .
i want to explain to you today , or something that you &apos;re probably familiar with is familiar with .
the mechanism is from a lie .
but don &apos;t you think about the lie as you might have heard , when people say , nobody has a wall .
and then rocks <unk> , so he &apos;s going to give you the picture .
you can see a lie that the liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes a light light that it has a different point in meaning .
he &apos;s just a and not even honest .
no , the lie about the i &apos;m talking about , who has to be compassionate themselves .
they need to take this lie to get a <unk> , to get an <unk> .
they can get less , yes , <unk> or even the <unk> .
they need time .
from this time , an anecdote that you might know .
spanish painter <unk> picasso once a woman .
this woman has complained that the portrait wouldn &apos;t you see her .
picasso : just wait .
it &apos;s always going to be more like .
and in this point , and if you laugh , you know how important is that lie and how much time you need to learn something , which artists can tell us to know , which artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
the artist is sharing with you , and particularly this lady , what you don &apos;t see if you just look at the mirror .
the artist is sharing to you in a portrait , which you will be familiar with , if you &apos;re going to look at this artwork of work .
and then that awkward feeling , it could not see you , and it &apos;s going to be more similar .
here , you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not only in art , also in the <unk> , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the story , it appeared .
you might know , that idea of the lady who looked into the mirror and looked at him , and he asked , who is the most beautiful in all the country ?
one day says that mirrors , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> .
and the one behind the seven mountains , and so on .
and you also know how much hostility to this true playfulness , even the mirror can &apos;t lie from that truly playfulness .
but we should just be familiar with , you know , you can &apos;t say , you can &apos;t say that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere in there .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to understand under <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re coming back .
we need to do this in this point that lie that we can &apos;t live in the <unk> , without the rest of us .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the <unk> , but also in science , but also in science .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s <unk> of <unk> .
it heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of the human .
that the person &apos;s being <unk> from the monkeys , yes , at least a common ancestry between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her man and said that , that &apos;s probably not true , which is charles there .
the person is supposed to <unk> from the monkeys or a common ancestry .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we have to prevent the people of it .
why do we have to prevent people about something , if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these <unk> .
because we &apos;re doing this <unk> , that feeling great , <unk> from the highest creatures , not from a <unk> , from a organism that exists , like a pebble , which is something like that , you know , the things that &apos;s for us .
so , we can &apos;t have this thing .
we have to prevent people understand the things of things , especially if you &apos;re true .
so , you see how slowly this mechanisms of fading fading and the tracks that it &apos;s leaving something that is to something else than this great image of us , and i want to give you a more story of the .
a particularly beautiful story , like me .
my wife has told me .
she came from the school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to love it , because it &apos;s a tilt for sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m in the fire department .
and because i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> things .
yeah , you feel it , if you &apos;re <unk> at this point . there &apos;s something that &apos;s wrong .
i said , i &apos;ve been told , whenever a person in a moral position , because we should try to replace it through the <unk> .
do that once and then you know the sentence .
although i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel , that &apos;s the real truth of the state .
so a little <unk> of <unk> , who &apos;s not a lot of <unk> .
the interest in the <unk> .
but there are no club , we can see how to learn where to learn how to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second thing , just the fire fire .
there he comes up .
and <unk> , you don &apos;t tell you that you would like to turn off by losing losing , and you &apos;ll be happy when the fire after <unk> .
no , it looks a lot better , if we show that we &apos;re in charge of the dangers , the other , they can do when they put fire .
here &apos;s this little mechanism .
this is that this <unk> that in the <unk> &apos;s <unk> , that he actually meant to fire , but he can &apos;t say it loud .
here you have this <unk> between what unconscious and the conscious who &apos;s immediately <unk> , without that you can do anything about it , and the things you know that they can look at much better for them and others .
so , just then those words that we also use the language in the politically use , and they &apos;re using the same speech .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know , if we &apos;re the authentic , the social proportions are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to work that kind of things in a society that should work to work .
so i want to tell you what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
what is the logic of these deception , these self-deception , the willingness to actually think of a different reality than we know what we &apos;re actually aware of what it &apos;s valid to the outside .
so , i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is how many of you know , and some of them , some of them , very few of them , very few of them .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so moral , says , about embraced .
it &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t be on , physical physical physical nature .
and if you have people who have a sense that they have a soul , or you can also say that they have been the soul to life , then , the way to the life of life , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
and by this soul , you &apos;re kind of like that in this nature of nature , in this nature of nature , <unk> , it &apos;s in latin latin , the <unk> .
and if that <unk> , over the people , it &apos;s filled with , with nature , with nature , who just live with nature , just with souls .
and then he can <unk> .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so she &apos;s supposed to go from the outside to the .
so , we should be able to perceive them as a thing that should be present for our lives .
and if you have this premise in front , you can understand the logic that we &apos;re going to experience that happiness through a lie to improve our world .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
you know , they &apos;re still in school .
now this is a <unk> which describes a logic which describes a logic .
that &apos;s the hardest part in my talk .
here you need something logic , but also the willingness to lie .
which is that you can just be able to apply these logic wrong .
in this <unk> , three sentences in this .
the first sentence is , <unk> , &quot; there &apos;s no soul .
so the second set is , if you &apos;re right , it doesn &apos;t have soul .
now , there &apos;s a third sentence .
i &apos;m in particular outline it in particular outline .
and a third set of , which is immediately , in people who have a strong sense of a soul .
the say who doesn &apos;t have soul , which is dead , and can &apos;t even claim anything .
and here &apos;s where you feel it .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> speech .
you can see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they are logical correct .
i can say it all .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a message about the reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , then the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , then the doesn &apos;t have a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say it .
but critically , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s just true .
so if <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have souls .
these things are logical correct .
and now our <unk> minds immediately , it can make something like it .
it &apos;s a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have anything with the first two sentences and that &apos;s what it &apos;s the opposite of the first sentence already proven to proven and as long as we .
because actually , we have to prove to whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , which it &apos;s simply using two sentences , and a third <unk> that looks like , as if he would have something to do with it , so we can save our <unk> .
so we pretend to be , as if it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we are very happy about it .
we can keep these things on different examples .
in the present , we have a modern example , which is always the <unk> .
and so , you have to be another <unk> issue , a <unk> of mind , to mind .
that &apos;s what it has to do that we go back into the <unk> century .
there was a <unk> who was johannes <unk> and after the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> who &apos;s inherently pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is such a <unk> .
and if you put it in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , he &apos;s <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a hell he should first go first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so the <unk> is introduced .
<unk> <unk> forces , each other on the other hand .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just if you get another example , so if you put a a a a a a a a bit larger , then it doesn &apos;t need an sense and anything .
and automatically , he &apos;s going to be the right thought .
if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of being driven by nature , it &apos;s going to be , from the larger pile that put a straight pile that just put a straight pile that have to be able to make it as a free will .
and if we &apos;re already in <unk> in the <unk> , i remember the <unk> of brain .
there &apos;s a <unk> who says wolf <unk> , and by him , you sometimes , wolf said , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can now have the second set of set up and say , if wolf has right , then he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read about daily daily daily daily , which is that you find in this third sentence .
it &apos;s about the way that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , not for his actions and claims to the responsibility , and he &apos;s therefore <unk> .
and here , you have it again .
actually , you have to actually prove to see if there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception is to be able to do that , as if the first sentence of the first sentence is wrong , but to take the opposite of the time before it would be before .
and now you can just if you want anything to do anything , if you want anything to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy to practice that courage to lie .
so , for instance , you know , if you meet a person , you can tell you , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which is called the prophet .
they shouldn &apos;t call it , that would be a little politically <unk> .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you &apos;ll be one , for the reason to give you this , of course , you know , you can &apos;t prove that .
and already , you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy with it , you can &apos;t prove it to be there , there &apos;s no <unk> , the man &apos;s very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s misled .
because he has led it on a <unk> , and he doesn &apos;t even even <unk> himself .
because actually , this man is not to be interested in evidence .
he &apos;s only interested in the , himself , <unk> , the need to prove to prove that there is <unk> .
so , in the way that is shifting the <unk> of the lie .
and once you have a way to have this <unk> , to feel that <unk> , in other people , do it , because they &apos;re going to make others happy if they don &apos;t remember your <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve allowed to have asked me to i &apos;ve been able to mention them .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here here by this great event , and asked me if i wanted to stop a lecture and my idea .
i have to say , you &apos;ve got it , it was hard to talk about my idea .
and i may perhaps think of my <unk> , i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but it &apos;s obviously the sum of all , very many ideas .
i &apos;m probably one of the two nice girls who are probably one of the generation that has made for this bad for that bad news has made for the , because i &apos;ve got to study robots in <unk> , technical college , which is where you , i think , &quot;
and i got it in the <unk> &apos; 80s , <unk> berlin , because i wanted to do renewable energy , and that was not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
the most of the time , they were all the <unk> , the <unk> was called <unk> .
the hot today is <unk> .
because a good engineer has either great cars or <unk> .
but it &apos;s like a <unk> like , like , <unk> , from a hundred watts of a hundred watts of the square meter coming out , it was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a <unk> <unk> system .
i &apos;m a <unk> grateful that he has to <unk> the word again , because after the <unk> , you didn &apos;t have to use the word anymore , because everything was left bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the <unk> years .
and there was the same time that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them sat in <unk> in the <unk> where you had the evil .
the place of the <unk> , but it was called <unk> and the solar power and and there i started the <unk> in the 1980s .
and yes , a lot of what i said , is very , very , because many , many beautiful expressions were , i &apos;ve been living through .
i worked in the age of 11 years , which was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if a no said , the <unk> , it was a complete <unk> , and i &apos;ve got a lot of a long time , i &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> , because i was all of colleagues of my father &apos;s <unk> , you &apos;ve got the money to the window for your child .
it &apos;s been busy with the tables .
and that was really very , very , very , and you also put it into so a <unk> , just dip that a picture , which i asked about 10 years , a thousand <unk> , of course , which was really so great to be the great thing .
and i got it up until <unk> , and then we &apos;ve got <unk> the company called <unk> , who was the <unk> <unk> of the largest <unk> of the world .
but a <unk> , but also , we have , and we &apos;ve got a <unk> problem , and we then have a little group , we decided that we &apos;re going to start small and go back and go back to the next issue of the future and that &apos;s what i think , is all the time we &apos;re talking about .
and i brought to a project i brought to you now .
and the title of the speech was , you know , as you go to 100 percent renewable .
and we just have just started asking a relatively <unk> story of asking where could you use a memory for a lot of the .
on this island , that &apos;s the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there &apos;s a half thousand people .
now , the <unk> of 15 percent today , is 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s not about technological .
if you get more <unk> each other , it starts to fail .
and i always tell the politicians , when they put our equipment in <unk> our facility .
and then they always say why ?
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
but , we &apos;re not , we have seven percent , and we have the european and our net , is physically the european .
if we had to have 20 percent , we have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , the one was , the first contacts to the isle of the island , the first time , the first time .
how big , it &apos;s actually a battery , so that you &apos;re going to be an island of 20 , 30 , 30 , 40 , maybe even 70 percent renewable gets .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go back a more <unk> .
the conventional system looks like this .
by the way , a year , roughly 100 <unk> electric performance , the world is to be on the world .
that &apos;s the equivalent of 100 nuclear power plant because it &apos;s all very fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world is going to be erased with diesel because you don &apos;t need permission .
this is fast .
you put it a deep box .
and then it looks like this .
in the same , three of the <unk> , two will always be waiting for .
yeah , so that &apos;s what it &apos;s the load .
we also get very detailed data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is in the rule , a <unk> system or a system , which is just in tiny quantities here .
and our goal was just to say , okay , &quot;
the diesel is going to <unk> and the wind , the sun uses the load , so that they can map the larger proportion .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent of renewables , so , energy per year , not the achievement at the moment , they have to turn off the diesel .
that is where the moment is to worry about that renewables can sort of take the entire network .
and that can &apos;t be , of course , if you &apos;re put it in some way , and you can be put it .
that &apos;s nobody in the world .
so , there &apos;s a little style , so you can also use your <unk> on a little <unk> of <unk> .
people are asking me , what do you get in <unk> ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
but if you want to be a lot of these <unk> <unk> and the one of the web , and that becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to 70 to <unk> , and then there &apos;s another thing that &apos;s last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very , very expensive and it doesn &apos;t work that you &apos;re doing that for batteries .
that will be a energy in the , which is hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you or <unk> , it will be it .
they &apos;d be more likely to go on a <unk> and <unk> and not just balance .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s a normal , <unk> battery battery .
how far is you , because there ?
and then , they &apos;ve got a lot of simulation .
and we have wind and the sun and the and the the result , and they came to the result , a very exciting conclusion that you take a <unk> in the conventional system that was a <unk> <unk> of about 50 cents per <unk> , about <unk> cents .
it was the very first case of the same calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business business .
we &apos;re cheaper as a <unk> , when the average rate is growing up five percent a year .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what would all be done ?
i negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for investors , i &apos;ve been looking for investment .
we were just about five people at the time to build a new place .
and here &apos;s what &apos;s a picture .
the brown is a very conventional system , the green green is our system .
that our system has a <unk> , because we &apos;re still going to have 20 percent of diesel and also a <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> that the <unk> that the <unk> on the island , it &apos;s what we find was great .
but we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe that you can solve the technical problem .
and so we &apos;re going to actually build a hall in berlin where we &apos;re sort of map the electrical proportions , in the scale of one .
that means we &apos;ve taken to find the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
it &apos;s all of asia , in the event of japan .
and <unk> , she &apos;s been in the &apos; 1970s , the bbc , and it &apos;s been designed by the bbc , and then became the <unk> of the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
she has a megawatts of power and can bring this thing for six hours long and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;re sort of <unk> <unk> .
and they set them .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as it is there , in the hall , in fact , this is complete dynamic behavior from this grid , so in the hall , it &apos;s the great battery , which we &apos;re doing the web .
here we have to take over here , the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the wire to sort of the <unk> in the web .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also <unk> kilowatts on the net .
here we see this again again , again again , again , the whole , <unk> .
and what we did , since the <unk> was the hall , until now , basically , all the way that is in between the individual system in electronics in software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company that is just between the theme and the subject and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , which you can also to communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is on the topic that you &apos;re basically , is all the <unk> of the problems that we get to get if we want to raise our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , as is going to go back and <unk> , <unk> , like that , for example , we have to take for example of <unk> to 30 percent <unk> , so we wind wind up the wind and the sun .
<unk> is a <unk> .
so , <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can do it on the island , and we can start to integrate the <unk> , you can manage it .
that is , if you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , then you can &apos;t make it without any memory .
you can <unk> through &apos; n , you can go through the bed nets , yeah , that should be in any case , you know , the percentage of <unk> , but you can never get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s like the message that &apos;s like , and that &apos;s like .
so many people , and look at it , because you can see what problems you get .
when we turn off the diesel , you don &apos;t have to have a sort of a circular mass that causes a certain amount of the net .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just <unk> masses of large <unk> , where the wave all over the way around europe is just a spinning .
we &apos;re looking at this grid , the 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s <unk> nine hertz , we start a few <unk> <unk> , then we &apos;ll get a little <unk> steam , then we get up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , it &apos;s incredibly <unk> .
if you get that somewhere , it takes a time .
the <unk> has to be at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , you can respond to other other .
if you don &apos;t have that circular mass , you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can have two milliseconds of times a <unk> .
and there &apos;s a already , you know , there &apos;s enormous <unk> .
and the message is now , we have to be edited up , we have to be <unk> , if we &apos;re going to be our goals 20 20 , 20 , 30 , thirty , thirty , thirty , thirty , thirty percent and so on , if we want to reach the at all .
and then we have to break our <unk> capacity .
<unk> is simply called the power station to keep the frequency .
yeah , that &apos;s a <unk> moment at the moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t have any or <unk> , because it &apos;s not about .
and we just try to make sure that you can get the capacity to get down the capacity to break down by using electrochemical memory .
and fortunately , there &apos;s also a lot of research , now .
and to this purpose , the people get to and look at our <unk> on the , sort of the <unk> of our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you get a very far of the future .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years , similar to the discussion i had in the last 30 years in the last 30 years .
don &apos;t go , is -- -- <unk> , we &apos;ve got all of all , ever .
we &apos;ve got 30 <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i just just just out that we will store the same capacity for the next 30 years , the same capacity to <unk> .
it &apos;s just going to come .
there &apos;s a whole bunch of <unk> and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve seen now in the last two years , that the scientists have to come on my side .
we &apos;ve got to get over 10 million <unk> , too , to go to the <unk> of the <unk> right now .
this is going to take place in the next april .
so , you know , you know , you know , there &apos;s a change , and it &apos;s just from this <unk> <unk> , to the notion , 100 percent renewable is that .
and if you have 100 percent renewable , then it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far in discussions , is trying to get these <unk> , which are <unk> , which have a own little net , which has nothing to do with our <unk> .
the question is very simple , if you &apos;re totally any of the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> <unk> , who will be <unk> somewhere in the world and they &apos;re going to be <unk> , then they &apos;re an island .
and then they &apos;re just going to consume what the sun and wind is there , where they live .
and that &apos;s so a little bit of our vision of an <unk> energy , and i &apos;m also grateful grateful that they &apos;ve said , solar power .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in that , the talk is that you can be a collective and to use the solar power , and here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yeah , i want to just encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little bit crazy and also have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty <unk> , but i think it &apos;s about .
thank you .
when steve lopez , he &apos;s the los angeles times , one day walking through the streets in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a teenager , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who had played on a violin , who had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because made of <unk> articles on this , and it was a book called <unk> junior junior , with steve lopez and jamie <unk> by nathaniel <unk> , and whose was was in a <unk> career , and whose <unk> career was very early early on his <unk> asylum .
nathaniel left , he was a <unk> , and 30 years later he lived as homeless to the streets of <unk> row at the center of los angeles .
i &apos;m going to to see all of you to read a book , <unk> book , and you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful bond that came between these two men , but also how the music was going to create the instrument that was going to make the <unk> , <unk> from the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall .
he just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and came up behind the stage to imagine .
he spoke in a very <unk> and <unk> sound about yo-yo ma and hillary and on how the dodgers would never create in the baseball world , and all the the <unk> passage of the last sentence in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we had to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email , in which was that nathaniel was interested in <unk> for me .
i have to mention that nathaniel was a medical treatment , because it was already with electrical electrical and with <unk> and handcuffed to , a conduit that he &apos;s pursuing his entire life .
now , as a result , he &apos;s particularly susceptible to these schizophrenic , and they are so bad , and he goes away , in the streets of <unk> row , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of his own mind .
and in exactly the same thing that nathaniel did was when we first met in the walt disney hall , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and had lost it completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and and on how to poison someone in the sleeping .
i fear was not <unk> , but i was afraid that i could lose it in one of his life , and i could actually <unk> his relationship with the violin , when i started talking about scale and other exciting forms of the <unk> <unk> .
so i just started playing with .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and while i played , i was in <unk> , that in the <unk> eyes was a complete change .
it was like it under the impact on a unseen , a chemical reaction , which was a catalyst .
<unk> <unk> <unk> turned to understanding , in a calm curiosity and grace .
and as by a miracle he took his violin , and he started playing a few of <unk> , and asked me to play it , and then they &apos;d come to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and we started talking about music , starting by playing beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he was not just a <unk> knowledge of music , but it also with her close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i only know about my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by talking about music , and he talked about music , was made of this <unk> , confused man who pulled on the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , fine , in the <unk> players .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
it &apos;s a very emotional one of the time for nathaniel .
because the music allows him to do his thoughts and delusions with the imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that exactly what is the nature of art .
that &apos;s the reason we do is the reason we do , we know , we know , that we &apos;re in inside of us , and our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our artistic lens , through reality .
and the reality that is that , and it &apos;s all , and it moves , inspired and together .
what nathaniel came up , the music brought him back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood him his talent and <unk> him .
and i &apos;m going to talk to nathaniel music , whether if in walt disney <unk> hall or <unk> row , because he reminds me why i got a musician .
thank you .
sorry <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i &apos;d like to play something that i stole the <unk> .
i hope you forgive me .
so i used to have a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two loved .
that first , that was more like a passionate about a passionate .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good , <unk> , a book on the menu .
what a fish .
more better , it was bred to be the highest standards of sustainability .
so you can feel comfortable with it , to sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty of a couple of months .
and one day called the head of the company , and i asked if i could send a guitar at a piece of the <unk> .
&quot; of course , i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this unimaginable has become our chefs , how do we keep fish fish on our <unk> ?
over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been <unk> the oceans as we &apos;ve been <unk> forests .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , which we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;ve collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , you know , or a matter , the <unk> , a part of our future .
many of the case , but <unk> <unk> the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we &apos;re taking tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds of <unk> , you need to get a pound of a pound .
not very sustainably .
don &apos;t taste very well .
so here finally , there finally , one company that tries to do it right .
i wanted to supported them .
on the day of the event , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call it don .
don &quot; don , &quot; just to say , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to grow so far outside in the ocean , that doesn &apos;t have polluted the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out the waste of our fish , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added to them , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one ? what feeds her ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and i was in bed at this evening , and i thought , what to hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i phoned the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he don &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to just just .
well , i &apos;m going to do a few people in the company , no one could give me a proper answer , until i finally give the age-old <unk> .
let &apos;s call it ourselves .
don &quot; don , &quot; &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , desolate , <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
in terms of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what is sustainably to feed the chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the university , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to get me from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually have a <unk> <unk> of this fish , because , i swear to god , who tasted fish after that conversation . chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of story of story .
it &apos;s the romantic kind of thing that you know , where you &apos;re getting to know , you know , you learn to you know , you know the fish you love .
i was eating him in <unk> first .
a <unk> journalist had been spoken by this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s got a kind of <unk> .
he came up on the table with a light , almost <unk> white paint .
the chef had him <unk> .
hold twice .
so , amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish so tasty after it &apos;s got to ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . actually , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he &apos;s got the fish not a <unk> , and it &apos;s not a chef , at least the way you and i understand it .
he &apos;s a a biologist in <unk> la .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> of spain .
she &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they grew up on what they were essentially the wetlands .
they did that by putting the land .
they built this complicated concoction of canals , and they kept out of water from the land and out in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it , not economic .
and it was a disaster disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds .
and so , a spanish company , a spanish company with green land .
what did they do ?
you have the flow of the water .
they literally have the dials .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to <unk> the water .
they were the channels of the canals .
they created a $ $ $ <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and it &apos;s <unk> and its company the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they look at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> channels and these density , lush march .
i was there not a long time with <unk> .
he &apos;s a tremendous guy , three parts of charles darwin and part of &quot; a crocodile to the kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were and fighting us through the and i <unk> and <unk> , and i have <unk> <unk> to my knees and <unk> keeps it in silence .
here he picks a very rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of <unk> .
and here , here is a pattern of artifacts that &apos;s reminded him to the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> is the largest part of the world &apos;s been spent in the <unk> park in the world &apos;s a lifetime .
i asked him how he has become a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relations .
and then he goes and fall over more <unk> of rare birds and algae and strange <unk> .
and don &apos;t understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak over the <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had the <unk> .
so i cut it . i said , &quot; <unk> , how come it , like it &apos;s going to taste it so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the <unk> , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do you eat ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he &apos;s driving on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish were eating what they were in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the toxic , the parasite banks , which is what it feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
the one farm is the farm , which doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
and i was driving on this site , and i asked him , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be , &quot; unlike any farm , which i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you have ? &quot;
and at the moment , it was like a director had a <unk> player .
and we <unk> around the corner and we provided the incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker , a literally pinker carpet that &apos;s so far .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at her <unk> , on the guitar .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you get your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> birds to the birds .
well , last year , on this day , 600,000 birds , more than 250 birds .
it &apos;s the biggest and one of the most important private enterprise in europe has become very europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> , the last thing you want to have to have a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> feed the shrimp .
the shrimp feed eating the toxic .
the pinker of the gut the system is better . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s think that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that is what they &apos;re doing on the health of their predators .
but a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this <unk> <unk> <unk> of the first time .
they &apos;re a breeding place in a city town where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning , they fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles back .
they do that because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i imagined penguins in a way i was imagined penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly you fly 240 miles to the farm , and fly back 240 miles back to night ?
do you do that for the children ? &quot;
and he looked at me , as a song from the whitney at the whitney .
he said , &quot; no . they do that because the food is better . &quot;
i &apos;ve &apos;t mentioned the skin of my beloved fish , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this <unk> , fuzzy flavor .
i &apos;ll never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried to put her in this restaurant in <unk> , she tasted all of <unk> .
she liked cute and it , as if you would take a bite a bite off the ocean .
i mentioned that to <unk> and he &apos;s <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense defense , before something in the body .
it &apos;s developed in evolution in the course of evolution . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that feeds their fish . a farm that measures its success , the success of their own success .
and then i realized , when he says a farm , which doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , he <unk> tremendous , because the water that comes from this farm flowing from the river of <unk> .
it &apos;s a river that is all the things that are rivers of rivers , they tend to lead to the chemical pollutants , the flow of <unk> .
and if it &apos;s fought by the system and it &apos;s <unk> water as it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed her animals not only a farm that measures their success on health of their own , but a farm which is literally a <unk> , and not just for you and me .
because when the water is , it &apos;s the ocean .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and you should do that , because these story story , like romantic as usual , is also <unk> .
you might say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future , whether we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in which food is actually taste fine .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re lover . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> , we love food ; we eat food .
and if you say that the things that are the the future of good food , somebody else to say , &quot; hey , &quot; hey guys , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are you feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough enough to feed the world more than only to feed .
one billion people are going to pollinate .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the <unk> inequalities , the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they will have the logic of our <unk> over the last 50 years .
using corn , <unk> <unk> , chemicals on the ground , chicken , and all the time they have <unk> bears , &quot; if we get more people cheaper , as awful , as bad can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the easy . it was the business business business business .
we should call them , which is a craft in <unk> , a craft that makes very fast -- <unk> capital , which is that causes this production .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is now threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of the resources of resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but not by a <unk> country , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by <unk> water , not by <unk> , but not by <unk> and nets , but by fish .
they want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how will we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that will enable people to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in it , and it never made something really good to eat .
let &apos;s take a look at the ecological model .
that &apos;s that , for two billion years of <unk> <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
in those who are not worlds , they are doing that , instead of <unk> , businesses , the <unk> , the <unk> , not only <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are experts for flavor .
and if i really are a better chef than i ever be .
you know , that &apos;s because the future is , because if the future is good food is it &apos;s delicious .
thank you .
if i want to show you a thing about what is that the sum of the data we consume , is bigger than the sum of their pieces and rather than to think of the difference , i want to think that pattern are going to be able to think that pattern are otherwise not visible .
so , what we put here is a typical <unk> of <unk> .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with a <unk> , i can be able to filter a given cause cause , let &apos;s say accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern , which is coming .
and that &apos;s because in the <unk> , there are the most the most the most the most the most the most the most the most the most the most are the most the most the most are the most the most <unk> .
we can go step further and and see the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we go to the time , and then , we say , we see 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the leading cause to worry about people .
and who &apos;s shown , that &apos;s true in men .
so you realize that &apos;s data and data in this way in this way in a lively <unk> .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for itself ?
what we &apos;re here is the <unk> of every single &quot; sport <unk> , &quot; which is ever printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can love to test it to my talk in the lab .
with <unk> , you can jump in a decade .
you can put in a particular year .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
now , when i look here , i see the athlete that come in this braille and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i &apos;ll give me all over here , and i &apos;ll see all of that i &apos;ll show you that i &apos;ll see lance in lance .
now , if i want to get a <unk> lesson , i could say , &quot; ok , what if i look at all of the subject ? &quot;
so i go to step back and take a look at a step .
now , i see greg <unk> .
and so you get a idea of that if you searched on this kind of information , <unk> , expansive , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t search or not just don &apos;t just look at it .
you make something that is a little bit different .
it &apos;s something between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
i want to do this idea a little bit more about what a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is , we took every single <unk> of oxygen , and it reduced them on a little summary .
and the summary is a short , and a symbol of the sphere you come from .
i just show the top 500 of the popular story .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the subjects that are on the top of the popular .
i &apos;m going to choose the subject &apos; government .
well , after i &apos;ve chosen government , i know that the <unk> , who are most <unk> , and the people &apos;s the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is a realization that is not in a single <unk> .
that &apos;s only to recognize one step back and look at it .
and a particular array of this summaries , i can go into the subject of time , &quot; people &apos;s the year , &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all these individuals , i realize that the majority are <unk> , and some of the science are coming out of science , some of the , coming out of the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono &apos;s also a ted prize winner .
so we can now jump and look at a look at all the ted prize winner .
you can see , we &apos;re browsing the web , as if it &apos;s really a web , not just from page , but a lot more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise of what a little surprise .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can take web pages -- and we &apos;re bringing this together to every single website like this .
so i can go back a step , and right to a specific <unk> jump .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you just look at the kind of web pages in this way , and in this way , the whole <unk> of the same way .
so i can look at my course in a particular place bar .
here &apos;s the one of the demonstration that i thought to this up to this .
and i can sort of sort of what i &apos;ve looked at today , again , again .
and , if i look at a step , and look at everything , i can turn my course , and i think , i think , &quot; i went looking for <unk> , &quot; right here , or here are live labs of <unk> .
and from here , i can go into the page and go to call them .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used to be used , and every time it makes the difference bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in the world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the oscar curse .
we &apos;re talking to &quot; drowning . &quot;
what if we could turn out this situation and turn the internet on the head that we &apos;re always going to go from one to the other , begin to many things , and so patterns that might recognize that otherwise hidden hidden hidden ?
if we can do this , then this bridge is that this bridge is , maybe a new source of information information .
and , instead of just in information , we can get to get out of it .
and if we know , we can actually get <unk> out of it .
so , i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
my high school , i drove to school , and i was riding an hour per day .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> , who was thinking about other worlds , and i think my <unk> in my <unk> , &quot; voracious curiosity <unk> <unk> .
and so this curiosity showed that i &apos;m not in school , and i was not in school , walking and <unk> , and they collected samples and snakes and bugs , and <unk> , and <unk> , everything after home and looked at the microscope .
i was completely <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and try to figure out the borders of the possible .
and my love to science fiction appeared to reflect in my environments because then we flew in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and went out the deep ocean .
jacques cousteau came in our living rooms with these fascinating shows that were animals and places and a world full of miracles that we &apos;ve never had never imagined before .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s got to be a good at that <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could painting .
and there &apos;s neither video messages even the <unk> of the media media , including the whole few things in the media media , i had to create the pictures in my head .
and that was that we all had to do that , and when we read a book , we took the description of the mountain and projected on the canvas in our heads .
my response was drawing and drawing of aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all kinds of things .
in the <unk> , i was constantly caught in the teacher , like i was , in the outside , <unk> .
the creativity had to be out .
and what i was interesting about this , which was fascinated by jacques cousteau , the thought of a <unk> world on our earth itself .
i certainly would never get a <unk> world with a spaceship , which seemed pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i actually could actually grow up here on earth , and she was just fascinating and exotic like all that i &apos;d ever imagined that i &apos;ve had this books .
so i decided when i was 15 to get the divers .
the only thing that was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let me frustrated .
i &apos;m a <unk> of my father until he finally had a <unk> in suny buffalo , and i was made , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
i did my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> of new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got to face two years later when we moved to california .
since the 40 years , the <unk> of <unk> , i spent about 3,000 hours of water in <unk> .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the ocean ocean , so rich in life of life , as we can &apos;t imagine it .
the worst of nature knows no limits , unlike our own , human imagination .
for today , i &apos;ve just been most deepest awe for what i see my dives on my dives .
and my love for the ocean is holding with the same intensity as ever .
and when i was a profession , i was a profession , it was the filmmaking .
this seemed the best opportunity to tell my inner to tell stories with my need to create images .
as a kid , i was constantly drawing books and so .
so , films were the way to bring pictures and stories together . that fit together .
of course , the stories i was told me , from the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , i could put my <unk> to the <unk> and and they connect to the filmmaking .
so , both of my two loves .
something interesting thing about &quot; <unk> , &quot; to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we drew this kind of liquid <unk> -- we drew <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
what it came out was the first <unk> <unk> that ever had to see in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t have a money , which he did just just to make his costs , but i realized something fascinating : the audience all around the world was <unk> by the magic that ran out .
according arthur clarke &apos; law is known to be a <unk> of technology and the magic to distinguish another .
so you saw something magic .
and that &apos;s what i found was incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must be involved in the <unk> of . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator , &quot; i &apos;m going to film , my next film , even more on .
together with dna , we made the guy out of liquid metal . the success depended on the way that this effect would be .
and it worked . again , we &apos;ve created something magic , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money on the movie .
from these two experiences , a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , with my good friend , in the time who was the best <unk> and <unk> was &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
so the idea of this company was to be able to use analog processes with visuals , etc and in the same way with digital <unk> .
and so we did that , and then we managed to have a competitive advantage for a while .
but the <unk> &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- which we actually started in the company , too slow <unk> .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which is the measuring things in visual effects and <unk> effects , with a lot of the expressive , expressive characters who were produced by <unk> , and the <unk> should be all the <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
but the bar that puts it a lot of , and the people in my company told me that we don &apos;t even be able to be able to create it .
so i shifted that , and then i did this the big bang over the big ship , the end .
and the <unk> , i &apos;ve sold that as &quot; romeo and juliet &quot; -- it was a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> , a really a great film .
but the <unk> , i wanted to <unk> the real train .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know , but not .
but i &apos;ve actually convinced them , i said , &quot; we &apos;re heading to the train . we &apos;re looking for the best train .
we &apos;ll show it in the <unk> of the movie .
that &apos;s tremendously important . it &apos;s a good example of marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this is again , that the imagination can create a reality .
and we actually actually created a reality six months later , which i was in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles under the surface of the atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a <unk> .
this wasn &apos;t film , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that blew me my mind .
and the amount of preparation was enormous . we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
and i fell on , like this , very much of these <unk> , a <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you &apos;re going to go into that capsule , then you have to have it down into this dark , <unk> environment , where don &apos;t have hope hope to get a long hope if you don &apos;t go back to it .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a <unk> .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , from the , who &apos;s curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature , for that we could design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was seeing outside of the <unk> .
and some of the past expeditions , i &apos;ve seen in <unk> , and sometimes things i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that had been seen before , and for the science of the time we saw , even in the time we saw .
so that &apos;s really <unk> me , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a little unusual decision .
after success , &quot; titanic &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in <unk> on ice and <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we were , we were coming to the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and they explored with <unk> .
we went back to the train .
we took little robots that we built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
our intent was , <unk> and the inside of the ship was never done before .
no one had the inside of the ocean ; it &apos;s not a means for that . so we developed the technology .
well , i &apos;m now , there on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see , the <unk> that had quite similar to the one that i know that once the band played there .
and i fly with a little <unk> scan by the ship &apos;s called the ship .
but i &apos;m actually , but my consciousness is actually only , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like , as if i was physically going to reach out of the titanic of the titanic .
that was the most <unk> form of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i took a <unk> , i always knew what was going to turn on the <unk> of the vehicle , because i was months of the <unk> of the vehicle , because i was a film on the movie .
and the set of the set was a detailed copy of the the blueprints of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
and she was able to realize that <unk> that you could use such a <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s conscious awareness in the vehicle , in which other forms of existence .
it was really tremendously .
and maybe a little peek on what might happen in a few decades , if you have a <unk> to explore something or to do something , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> that i can imagine as a <unk> .
after these expeditions , we started to see what we saw down the bottom , for example , these <unk> <unk> , where we saw these amazing amazing animals , which is like , it &apos;s like , but here on earth .
they live with the help of <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a on sunlight , how we do that .
and so you see animals that can be right next to 500 500 celsius , and they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in <unk> , and i was a very much for <unk> , which was my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and the and the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be in the <unk> and right now , and through russia , through the mission to the <unk> protocol , and then we go to international <unk> and take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but the end was , it was out that i took a <unk> in the deep sea .
i took them with and <unk> them to the world , <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources with so that they could take samples and take the data and take the tools and the tools that we could take and testing the tools .
we did , in the haiti , but actually , science , actually , <unk> .
so , the circle between my existence , as a child , then as a child , and that implementation in reality .
and in the course of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot of learned .
i &apos;ve learned a lot of science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re certainly to be a director , a director has to be a leader , a guide , or something like a <unk> .
i don &apos;t mind a lot of leadership before i <unk> these expeditions .
because at a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what comes out ? &quot;
these <unk> films don &apos;t make a money .
we &apos;re just playing the cost cost , from fame .
all of all think i &apos;m going to be between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have <unk> the nails on a a beach on a beach .
i &apos;ve got all these films , these documentaries documentaries made for a very small audience .
no glory , no credit , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it to the task , to the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that are there . you &apos;re doing it for the <unk> because because of weird connection that comes when a small group of people make a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked worked for years , and sometimes we were going to have two to three months in a row in a row in a row .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the aware that you have to each other , because you &apos;ve been able to have a task that you can &apos;t explain anything else .
if you go back to shore and says , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the whole way around , the whole technique , and the trouble , the human <unk> , and the trouble , the human <unk> , and the trouble , you can never explain someone .
there is a connection , which is respect with each other .
so when i went back to the next film called avatar , and i tried to apply the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re respected and being a lot of respect to return .
and this is what the dynamics was really changed .
so , i stood back with a small team on the <unk> terrain , and we were &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that was not before .
so exciting .
an awful challenge .
and we were to a half of a half years to a very big family .
it changed my way to make films .
there were people who were , we had actually <unk> this <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the planet .
for me , it was more a kind of <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that has changed in the result .
so what can we close out of all ?
what lessons we learned ?
i think about first , the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the stranger of your teams is more important than all the world &apos;s world .
and to me , young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me a advice to how i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t you a .
the other thing is , don &apos;t do it for you , bet you don &apos;t bet yourself , you don &apos;t bet you . &quot;
nasa has such a <unk> , &quot; failure is not alternative . &quot;
but in art , and it has to study a alternative , because there &apos;s a <unk> that there is a <unk> .
not an important endeavor that was called innovation , was ever been addressed .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
that &apos;s the thought i &apos;d like to give you to the way , and it &apos;s not an alternative , fear , but is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that may be surprising because my <unk> is in the foundation , is mainly to vaccines and a seed , to make the things that we invent and deliver to deliver the poorest billion a better lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people , actually , even more than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> is not growing in many years , and it &apos;s too little too little rain . and things are going to change how it can &apos;t withstand your fragile environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to the communal .
so , you will have an important terrible thing for you .
and also , the <unk> is very important for them .
the fact is that if you could only reduce the price of the price , energy , energy is far by the most effective .
well , the <unk> is over time .
in fact , the <unk> <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re refrigerators , we can make modern materials and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation to the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- we &apos;re going to meet the price -- we &apos;re going to meet a new barrier and this barrier is on the way of co2 .
co2 warms the planet and the equation for co2 , is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the <unk> carbon , which leads to the <unk> and this <unk> has a very negative consequences . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the <unk> that that can &apos;t adapt to change changes and make all the systems .
now , the exact context between a <unk> and and the <unk> of <unk> and where they &apos;re still with the other effects there , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity that are going to be those of the things , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the <unk> several times , &quot; we &apos;ve got to get down to zero ?
is not that half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will rise .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we have a <unk> truck , which has to be under a foot of m and then you can put it out of it .
this is a very to go down to zero .
well , we &apos;re going to make a lot of <unk> every year , about 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons of tons , people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of for every one on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that down to zero .
it &apos;s a constant time .
only different economic changes has been influenced at all , and we need to have to go from excess efficiency to zero and zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing to the left -- it &apos;s co2 -- that &apos;s going to to get to zero and the of the number of people who &apos;s using average energy for every service and co2 , which is a unit of energy .
so let &apos;s take a factor of a factor , and we think about how we get it down to zero .
probably one of those numbers have to come very close to zero .
now that &apos;s fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through .
first , we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people today .
and it takes me to nine billion dollars to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , which is <unk> and <unk> , we might probably reduce the <unk> for 10 percent or 15 percent , but at the time we see a mere one of a 1.3 .
the second thing is the services that we use .
it includes all the food that we eat , clothing , <unk> , heat .
that &apos;s very good things and <unk> , that to almost to make it to almost any of the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number is going .
in the high-income world , in the upper billion , we could probably make it <unk> and less use , but on average , that number of each year , and so much more and so much more and more than double the number of services that can be put together per person .
here &apos;s a very basic service , and there &apos;s a home of light , so you can get to read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
well , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going to go .
due to different successes of different successes , by other <unk> , through new methods in the <unk> , there are many services , their energy , and they &apos;re all the services , their energy , and to 90 percent .
in other parts like this is like <unk> , 105 loads : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> or <unk> , is the parking lot of a lot smaller for improvement .
in fact , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe maybe maybe a factor of three or maybe even to six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now by 26 billion dollars now , we &apos;ve gone back to <unk> 13 billion tons . and that just doesn &apos;t just be enough !
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor of -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that will be <unk> per unit of energy .
it turns out the question you can get that to zero .
if they burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every <unk> of electricity is co2 , except renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do on a global scale , is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the term &quot; miracle , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonder .
usually , there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
normally , you just just wrong , and some of them , you don &apos;t .
in this case , we have to give up a <unk> and a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i bring that ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration , which is the idea of people here ?
i remember last year ago when i brought it and somehow liked it .
the idea was really , you know , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , i fell here for energy .
i decided that was the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> to the environment .
so here &apos;s a few natural fireflies .
and they told me that they don &apos;t bite you . actually , you don &apos;t think the glass left .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t get a lot .
we need solutions , either one or many of the one or have a tremendous amount of scale and unimaginable to have a lot of ways in which people are looking for , i really see five to these big demands .
i have the tides , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
now , these may maybe a <unk> , and if you do better than i expect , it would be great , but my message is that we have to give them all five to be , and we can &apos;t give them from them because they &apos;re all significant problems .
let &apos;s see the burning fossil fuel , burning burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is , maybe simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to have all co2 , which is the burning of the <unk> , it allows you to store , under pressure and hope that there &apos;s there .
there &apos;s some <unk> that can create it on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to 100 percent of it will be very difficult , and one of them may be a big challenge for skeletal properly , is a big challenge .
who will make it ?
who can do something that literally , for a lot of billions times larger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a hard thing .
next : <unk> .
it has three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are up , and the question for certainty you really feel nothing wrong , despite the human &apos;s worth the fuel that is not used to weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s what you should work .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve put in .
it &apos;s the renewables as they &apos;re being called .
and also , it &apos;s great , although it &apos;s great to have no fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
it &apos;s the energy density that make these technologies are generating dramatically than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , 1,000 times more of a normal power station .
and then these vents are <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be a day , it doesn &apos;t seem to either day and as well , the wind is not constantly constantly .
that &apos;s why you have to rely on those sources , the energy in times when they &apos;re not available to get .
so there &apos;s big <unk> . there are challenges at transmission . if we say that the power source is beyond the country , they don &apos;t just need to use technology , also , you have to deal with the risk that the energy of where our comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve got all kinds of batteries , and the ones that are made , the cars , computers , cell phones , cell phones , for everything , and that &apos;s what i was producing less than 10 minutes of the <unk> .
so we need a big breakthrough , something that is going to be 100 better than the approaches to the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to say these <unk> sources , we &apos;re going to get 30 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to rely on 100 percent of them , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where are we going to go , what is the right approach ?
a &quot; the garden of &quot; ? how are we going to be on the destination ?
what we need is many companies working on this . hundreds of .
so in each of these five , we need at least 100 people .
and many will you say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many , getting engaged in there .
and bill big has many companies , including a guy called <unk> who has great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies doing great things and interesting and interesting opportunities and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company , which maybe , maybe , very surprisingly , tracing the nuclear approach .
there &apos;s some innovations in the <unk> ; <unk> , it &apos;s liquid .
now , the development has stopped in this industry at some time , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts looked around .
the <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , one percent , which is a percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent of the <unk> .
it &apos;s a rather crazy idea .
but actually , you &apos;ve been thought about it , but you could never have to simulate any kind of thing that it would work , but then modern supercomputer can be able to simulate it and see that , yeah ! the right car , it looks like this .
and because you &apos;re going to burn up , it &apos;s a lot better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use waste of today &apos;s done as a <unk> .
instead of just <unk> the head , you just burn it . a great thing .
so , it &apos;s also incremental , a little like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a a column , often as &quot; like the tiger wave . &quot;
it really solve the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s being burned , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
that &apos;s the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re inexpensive and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testament to look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many of them talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in the poor , and still , it &apos;s still , and hopefully , and it &apos;s hopefully clean and cement to be clean .
so , to reach this 80 percent , the developed developed , including countries like china , their <unk> .
the other note is , if we use the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way you get to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is a key feature of this .
if we go back there , how should this be testament to look at ?
it should be both the two elements .
we should use the <unk> to get reducing reduction on the path , the less we are <unk> , the lower the <unk> and the temperature also .
but actually , this is the grade for the things that we do not completely lead to the big <unk> , just right , or even something less important as the others which the speed of innovation for these are .
these are also , we have to track with <unk> , and we can measure them : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books on this topic .
al gore &apos;s book , &quot; we have the election , &quot; and david <unk> , the hot energy . &quot;
they &apos;re going to really go through and create a framework where this this can be discussing and we need for all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of that comes together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very more comfortable desire to do that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose a vaccine , and that love me , or i could choose this wish , which is , <unk> <unk> , without co2 , i would take a wish to take a wish for a wish .
that &apos;s the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the trench will be in between the long and the <unk> , people will be terrible between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich and almost all lives of those two billion will be much worse .
so what do we have to do ?
for what do i do ?
we need to utilize for more screening .
when countries make in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t be just about co2 .
they should discuss these <unk> , and they would shocked to be ridiculously low money that will be spent for innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and trade something that creates a <unk> .
we need to spread the message .
we need to engage dialogue and and the things that are being taken from the government .
it &apos;s a important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to try to understand something better -- first , you can give us an idea of scale of that power ?
bill gates : to get a <unk> of a supercomputer , all the great scientist we did , we need to have some 10 million , and even if we have tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s sensible , you just have a lot of <unk> million .
the hard step is to find the first <unk> of the world , and the <unk> and the place in fact , the first of it .
and once the first finished , when he &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s all clear , because the economy , the energy density is so different than the way we know it .
to understand that really , that means deep into the ground , almost like a vertical column , that consumed , and then the process starts up and it &apos;s moving down to the bottom ?
<unk> : right . now , you have to get the reactor , so many people and lots of the control that can go wrong . this thing you open and or <unk> or <unk> . that &apos;s not good !
but if you have a cheap fuel , you can put it for 60 years -- think of a column that you buried , without the entire complexities of the whole complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and they &apos;re going to go 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , who is a solution for the garbage .
<unk> : yeah . now , what happens to the waste , you can sit there -- there &apos;s lots less waste with this method -- then they take it and put it into the next reactor and burning it .
and we start by taking the waste , which already is in this <unk> or <unk> of it . that &apos;s our <unk> .
so , what these reactors was a problem , which is what we put in our put in our own and and it will reduce dramatically as much as this process .
but while they &apos;ve talked about the world of these choices over these ways .
where is the biggest interest , what really do ?
<unk> : well we haven &apos;t set ourselves into a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> for all the &quot; nuclear &quot; -- there are great interest and the people of the company in russia , india , china , china , china , and talked about how this was the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is a variant of one thing that was done .
that &apos;s a important step forward , but it &apos;s like a speeding out of these , and some countries have this , so everyone who has made a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your notion , timeline , and probability of really a really good ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to invent and then for 20 years .
that &apos;s kind of the deadline that has demonstrated the <unk> of the g20 that we have to leave .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything &apos;s fine , and that &apos;s a big wish , it might be easily .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need to need hundreds of companies that work , the way that they work for the <unk> for the pilots to make it .
and it would be best if it can do , because then you could use a mixture .
so , every case we need a solution .
now , the big breakthroughs , is this is the biggest thing that you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> , is the most important thing .
it would be also without the <unk> , but it makes it so much more important .
in nuclear sector , there are other innovative .
you know , we don &apos;t know as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems to a slightly difficult , but maybe you might say that about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beauty is that a <unk> has a million times so much energy like a , say , a <unk> and so , if you can deal with problems and other things , almost in a league in their own league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to turn <unk> <unk> to try to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you get in this situation , it &apos;s like you too , it &apos;s like you too much , and you know a heart attack , which is what you do ? you might have a <unk> or something .
there &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> , which is working with various techniques to delay the warming , so we &apos;re going to give it for 20 or 30 years longer for us to take care of us .
it &apos;s just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need it .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t be in the insurance because you might not make sure , you know , so you you &apos;re eating , because you know that one will save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re smart , if you &apos;re going to take the importance of this problem in front , but there &apos;s a conversation in <unk> about whether the things are going to be , and that innovation is longer , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
<unk> : have one or two sentences for you to do you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are the skeptics in very different camps .
those who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
say that there are negative effects that are going to do with the clouds that are going to move ?
there are very , very few things that can you at all , which is a chance of a chance to have a chance .
the <unk> here is as much as a aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot of a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of problems in trouble in doing something that you &apos;re about to do , and that is that investment is not so clear . actually , it &apos;s not big drama .
the fact is that that uncertainty is that that uncertainty should be us .
but my dream here is that if you can do economic , and the co2 , the the <unk> , they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s cheaper to me , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method .
and that would be their answer to the <unk> argument that if you use all of that time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals is a bad waste of resources , and better things we can do .
<unk> : now , the actual spending for research -- say the u.s. should say that u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
that &apos;s not suffering from other things .
and you get to big <unk> , and here can disagree with a people who disagree with , if you have something that &apos;s not an economic , and tries to finance it .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short ago , and i &apos;ll fund the learning curve , i think we should try to try and try to be much more than being a lot of less than being more than being a lot of getting .
if the <unk> of the <unk> , you can get a very high <unk> , then just the rich with it .
i mean , each one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without change their lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> .
his new <unk> is , &quot; why is not the research is going to be discussed anymore ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be , because of his previous stories , with the <unk> associated with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and so he &apos;s now doing the <unk> .
and that &apos;s a thought that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy as a little bit of the commitment .
so , bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all people , and i &apos;m hoping that you will be true , and thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , named peter <unk> introduced a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> .
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> need to be the biggest <unk> structure with 20 , about three feet tape , about three feet thread and a <unk> .
the marshmallow has to be up on it .
and , although it seems really easy , it &apos;s actually hard to work , because it &apos;s pushing people very quickly work .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops , with students , innovators and architects , even with <unk> of the <unk> and and there &apos;s something about this task in which deep sensations that makes collaboration collaboration and i want to share some of them with you .
normally , the most people start to get to the task .
they &apos;re talking about it , you think about what it &apos;s going to look like , it &apos;s going to make it look .
and then you invest a little bit of a time in planning and organization . and is , and are a spaghetti .
they spend a lot of their time in the <unk> <unk> of the time .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have a time , take the marshmallow and they gently put it carefully at the top , step back and &quot; <unk> &quot; ! you &apos;re admire her work .
but then , almost always , is that the &quot; <unk> is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weight of the <unk> makes the whole thing , the whole thing will bend and <unk> .
there are a number of people who have more &quot; <unk> , &quot; and under the <unk> , and under the <unk> , the <unk> .
they lie , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re <unk> and make really <unk> figures .
and of course , there teams have been the much more &quot; <unk> , and under the best are fresh fresh york to the <unk> .
and that &apos;s quite amazing .
as peter did not make them , they &apos;re not only the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is , how does that ? why ? what ?
and peter tells , &quot; neither of the children spend time to be the boss of spaghetti <unk> . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in <unk> time .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> trains to find a right plan , ok !
and then it &apos;s what .
what happens when they put the marshmallow on the top , they don &apos;t have a time more and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s a different thing that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they were <unk> the opportunity to repair the possibility of repair .
and <unk> is that kind of collaboration as a <unk> of a <unk> .
and with every try and get the kids directly and what &apos;s not going to work and what &apos;s not .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , is much , but we &apos;ll see how different teams act .
the average of the average of the most of about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , a few of them , but not much , more <unk> are better than adults .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
architects and engineers , to happiness .
<unk> is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they &apos;re seeing triangles and <unk> geometric geometric patterns that are key to build robust structures .
ceos are something about average , but here &apos;s interesting .
you put a <unk> administrator on the team , it &apos;s significant better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of the <unk> .
they &apos;re bringing the process , you understand it .
and that team that is in the <unk> and the work is the power of the teams of the team .
specialized specialized and <unk> and <unk> and their combination .
if you have 10 teams , the typical work , they get about six , the stable structures .
i tried to do something exciting .
i thought , we &apos;ll bring the <unk> .
so i offered a $ $ $ a prize for the winner .
what do you believe about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built a <unk> built , he would have carried the price home .
so is it &apos;s not interesting that high <unk> have a strong effect ?
we replay this exercise with the same students .
what do you think about this ?
now , they understood the the advantage of &quot; prototyping .
that &apos;s what it was like , bad team one under the best .
it produced the highest construction of the time .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about the nature of being a and success .
you like questions : why would someone actually make a time to create a <unk> ?
the reason is i &apos;m helping digital tools and make a teams to help teams , to help teams , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> is doing , they &apos;re helping to identify assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language or an common language , and the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of thing .
and those of you who are interested in the <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
they &apos;re looking examples of the world , like people doing the system and <unk> .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport is .
it demands that we all have our senses on the task , and that we think we think optimal , how our emotions and our do in the challenge that lies before us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience , which is it all to us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment . &quot;
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s do that as we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool machine , and it &apos;s a machine machine .
and everyone in this room has to be in .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what you &apos;d choose , because i &apos;ve asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or twitter or or or the american search of the world .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of being drawn to the <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i am a adventurers .
it &apos;s because of the possibilities on this planet doesn &apos;t go back on this planet .
so i want to do this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that there was the greatest time that there was the most of the time , whether the scale you are : health , wealth , wealth , mobility , the declining times .
there was never been a time like this .
my <unk> , all of the they were 60 .
my grandparents separated that number of <unk> .
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
so , there &apos;s better at the beginning of my <unk> , and i should be <unk> .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who &apos;s born in delhi today , as long as the world &apos;s richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox : smallpox , smallpox , have killed billions of people on this planet .
they have a new form of earth in a way , as it &apos;s not done a war .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have them <unk> . phew .
in the high-income world , the millions of us are still threatened by a generation of the generation .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anyone know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try things like if it works , it &apos;s going to change it , which is the greatest of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve been often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , all of our achievements have a billion people on this world every day .
that number is growing up , and it gets very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to <unk> this world .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , gas , and it &apos;s soon , and that &apos;s all , and if we don &apos;t go out of chaos <unk> .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food , which will feed billions , without the country , to rape them , to rape .
i think we can power this world to energy that they &apos;re not destroying it .
i think that really , and no , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is holding me up at night -- one of the things that lie on you awake , and we still have scientific progress in the way that we have to do .
and we also had never been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it today .
we &apos;re at the brink of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think that we &apos;ve got hundreds of , 300 years ago , to find a time where we &apos;ve been in progress in the world we have more <unk> , right now .
people are moving in their faith , and that &apos;s so closely you can &apos;t free them .
it &apos;s not even the truth of it .
and listen , everyone has a right opinion , even a right to the progress .
but you know what they don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have a right on their own facts . &apos; <unk> , don &apos;t have it .
and i took a while to figure out that .
about a decade ago i &apos;ve written an article about for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed to make a opposition to make it in opposition to what the most effective activity in the end of mankind &apos;s history .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i just did what i do , i wrote an article and continued on .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetically engineered food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people played crazy .
so i wrote a article on this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why the people thought that would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules was a random kind of a <unk> on the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article i did .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we &apos;re going to think we &apos;re eating , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
but this article was me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it .
and that &apos;s because these guys who were mad who were mad , were all the <unk> .
these were well-meaning people , intellectual people , intellectual people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that &apos;s me so disturbed .
but then i thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
we &apos;ve got to a point where we &apos;re not the same relationship to the progress as the past .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about it , with little quotes , with a little quote . &quot;
okay , so there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what reasons are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science of all lost , and there &apos;s no reason that shouldn &apos;t be so .
you can just call them a few names and you get people to understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , weapons of mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people who we believed that they &apos;re always going to be right . so are they &apos;re skeptical .
ask you ask , please demand evidence , demand them .
take a case of them as an given .
but now , it &apos;s : if you &apos;re going to get evidence to you , and it &apos;s not good good .
and i can tell that from the reason that we &apos;ve now in an epidemic of fear , as i haven &apos;t seen it and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
very frightening .
there were lots of studies to see if that was correct .
there are lots of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from the u.k. , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in anecdotes , we think what we see what we think about what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a <unk> of us , and i understand that , and i understand that , i think that we all do .
but you know what ?
the result was devastating .
<unk> because of this is the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> <unk> <unk> for measles .
that &apos;s <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what &apos;s happening is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i understand that .
did anyone here ?
has one one in the audience who ever die of measles ?
not a lot of time .
now in this country , but 160,000 times in the world in the last year .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths by measles , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not here , we can be <unk> it , and people like jenny <unk> , and and the messages from fear and and around and the and around and the <unk> and larry king live live .
and that can make them because they can &apos;t connect cause cause and connection .
you don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the most important human race .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , vanished .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s developed a few other people a <unk> .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that &apos;s good , besides that paul &apos;s wrapped and and the and says , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop moan .
and that &apos;s actually what he &apos;s actually .
paul is a <unk> .
if paul &apos;s talking to a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell the armed arms of .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where your children go to school .
and why ? because paul has done a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
take them on , they return to the disease , terrible disease , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
we &apos;re now <unk> in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , children will die back to die because it &apos;s just one question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not going to die of measles .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a <unk> of mine has written me a couple of weeks ago , and i said , i was a little bit of <unk> .
nobody ever said that was ever before .
she would not be her child against <unk> .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a <unk> , and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
now , i don &apos;t know , maybe in a <unk> morning , in a airplane , and you &apos;re going to los angeles , right now he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he &apos;s going to land and <unk> a car , and it comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of those <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because the world works .
that &apos;s the planet that we live on . don &apos;t it as if it &apos;s not like it .
we love to reproduce ourselves . we love this .
did you take all their vitamins tomorrow ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that helps you to make .
i know they did that because half the americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take an alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
they make their urine darker . they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , you like to have 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m completely .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government ; we don &apos;t have trust trust .
and that &apos;s not , we should not . our health system is it .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and <unk> itself to us who can afford it .
so we &apos;re going to run away , and where are we going ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars for it .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little props here .
none of it -- <unk> , cheating , cheating , cheating , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars for it ; it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? if i say that , let me tell people to say , &quot; what cares ? let &apos;s do people doing what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s the <unk> who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to give you the evidence of the expert of mammography , &quot; or any <unk> of the patients who wants to treat patients with <unk> .
if you go to this way , where believe and the magic of evidence and science is to be able to get a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they &apos;re getting to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 people to do , because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more effective than antiretroviral drugs we know that they can get the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that will be worse than any other one of that disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have . they always have them .
now , the <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re in is this ridiculous battle between the <unk> genetically genetically food foods and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
everything we eat every <unk> , every <unk> , every <unk> , and every <unk> , it &apos;s changed by the people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did it .
we did it in the last few years .
and some of it has not work and some of it .
we got rid of that , which doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more . and of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , to augment their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
we re-engineering food altered food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m constantly hearing is to many chemicals , hormones , hormones , hormones , we don &apos;t want a huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want to patent companies to live .
we don &apos;t want to have companies .
and you know , what &apos;s my answer to all this ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but it &apos;s not science .
it &apos;s not doing with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work and sometimes , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid to do a real <unk> , and it &apos;s a millions of people from the randomness .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have to grow 70 percent more food than the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it .
and why ? re-engineering food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like cassava .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s a half billion people .
it &apos;s about how a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s it .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all that one right there .
and then the people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they would not starving , and you know what ?
it would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be nice .
and all i can say , what do we do to do is : why do we fight it ?
i mean , we ask : why do we fight it ?
because we don &apos;t want to have genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes , genes , it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our iconic passion for hormones , our insect &apos;s greater food , better food , more food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s a time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re doing so far , we make something guilty about something that we do , i think , not guilty about high-tech , <unk> colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our <unk> , and we have to stop it .
so after this incredibly fun conversation , you might say , &quot; you want to be into this ridiculous machine , and you know ? &quot;
anyway . this is what i want to do .
and at the moment , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this machine machine , what we want .
we can <unk> them where we want to <unk> them , and we will move them to go to where we want .
we need to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we get into the time time and go into the future , we &apos;ll be happy to have made this .
i know we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while i &apos;m interested in the <unk> , and it may seem strange that a magician was interested in , because you look like me as being a delusion that &apos;s going to something real , if someone believes in the next time someone believes in . &quot;
in other words , <unk> have been a measurable effect , which is that , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what happens to her , is a <unk> or a kind of ... in the <unk> , for example , there &apos;s a deep effect of the body that you call the <unk> .
a deception is going to something real , because somebody &apos;s so aware .
so , we can also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple trick trick .
and i &apos;ll show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least since the 1950s in every <unk> of children .
i myself , i &apos;ve learned him by the <unk> <unk> magic in the 1970s in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain him .
so , look what happens .
the knife that can examine , my hand , which you can see .
i &apos;m going to hold the knife just so in my own .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out , i just get my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time to do anything . so long as i &apos;m here , can &apos;t get off my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is just simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is fine , the knife will hold by my bare physical .
it &apos;s actually so rigid in his place , that i can shake it without the knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or comes out , not <unk> . and you can examine it all .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often often <unk> kids to be <unk> because you can learn a lot of a lot of about deception if you look closely , although it &apos;s a very simple trick trick .
now , you know , many of you here in the room this trick .
it &apos;s like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say that i &apos;m my wrist <unk> , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m my wrist , is that there &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
and in the moment , where i &apos;m going to take my hand from you to see you from the back , and then this one , my <unk> , just by where he was , in a position that he &apos;s so <unk> .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone who had a childhood who had no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and if i <unk> , the fingers changes his position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are just three fingers down to see , because the intellect and the way that it processed , one , two , three , three , but they see as a group .
but that &apos;s not really , and then i open my hand .
and of course it will be there , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now .
and if i close my hand , the same thing that i &apos;m going to leave by by that , through this movement , that the fingers will go back .
i take this hand off . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can you your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does that do with the <unk> ?
a year ago , or so , i read a study that really has my my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing .
and what it is , if you put a placebo in a form of a white pill , in the shape of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular effect effect .
but if you shape the shape that they give an h5n1 give an example of a smaller pill , and that blue color and a letter that you can see is actually measurably effective .
and that , although no one of any <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as well as a blue pill .
what ? that made me crazy .
it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take capsules capsules that &apos;s more effective than any shape .
a <unk> capsule that &apos;s yellow , and the other red is , is better than a white capsule .
and the throughput is a role .
a pill twice a day is not as well as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the very consideration . i &apos;m sorry .
now , the key thing is ...
... that also the <unk> of play .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to reach into the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you injected in a patient .
that creates a very powerful picture in your head . that &apos;s a lot stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;ll give you a different time if we have an analog projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem as well as the blue pill , it acts as well as a capsule that acts as well as the needle .
and none of it has a really disturbing property , and it &apos;s just our belief that it &apos;s a stronger effect of it .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that &apos;s obviously a pretense , and it &apos;s really going to look real .
we know that from the study that you have to reach into the needle when it &apos;s supposed to go to the thing .
this is a <unk> <unk> long . it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , and i &apos;m going to start a little bit of a little bit of <unk> .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a feature effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m now going to stick this needle into my skin and through it until you go through the other side , he catches up .
if you &apos;re bad -- if you fall down , i &apos;ve demonstrated a couple of friends at the room room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s been nearly powerless .
so i propose to make you quickly , you &apos;ll look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first delicate part here in the back .
you can see it in the same , but they can also be <unk> if you want .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , right here where my meat is , the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
sorry . sorry . does it crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side , and then it .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the <unk> .
about .
but now , you can &apos;t count my finger , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , well , well .
i know what people think about when you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> yourself the skin , just to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people back to say , &quot; okay . i don &apos;t have this right right . &quot;
the people in the <unk> are now in .
let me show you from the closeness .
this is really my skin . this is not a feature effect of hollywood .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can do this .
sorry . if you &apos;re miserable , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
the people in the back or the , that would be on video , and you &apos;ll say , &quot; well , this is quite impressive , but if it &apos;s real , it would be a hole and there , if it really would be a real , it would bleed out .
okay , let me take a little blood for you .
yeah , here &apos;s it .
so , i would take out the needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no <unk> .
but i think in this framework and with the intention of making a a illusion of a illusion , i &apos;ll just put the needle just there and go off the stage .
we will have a couple of time in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll be happy for it . thank you .
everyone &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve been published the number of books that were happiness in the past five years and they were published about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness under the researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
and everyone would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these <unk> of work , there are several cognitive ones that are kind of almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly by the <unk> of action .
it &apos;s true for <unk> who think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out that we are so mess , like everyone else .
the first one of that , is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word because we &apos;re using it too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could limit it , but in the big , and all the thing that we have to give up , and we &apos;re going to consider the complicated view of what is well-being .
the second thing is that is mistaken and memory : basically , you &apos;re between happiness in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that is the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without its meaning to disgust .
i mean , this is a real cognitive event .
there &apos;s no way to get it right to the .
now i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a <unk> , and one of my lectures , who reported a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he had a symphony , and it was a <unk> <unk> of the sound .
and then he added to them , really , really emotional , that &apos;s ruined all of the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it has been ruined the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of <unk> music .
they didn &apos;t do it because he was a recollection of <unk> ; that drew memory was anything he had to keep it .
what we really says is that we think about ourselves and thinking about other people in the senses of two types of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present , is capable of being able to experience the past , but basically just the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt when i put it out ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that the <unk> and the history of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor asks the question : &quot; how did you feel in lately ?
or &quot; how did your journey torture ? &quot; or something like this .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self and the two too , is part of the <unk> of happiness .
now , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that &apos;s really , with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories about , if we make ourselves stories , and tell stories .
our minds tells us stories that means what we &apos;ve been to do with our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with a example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients that did a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details , and it &apos;s not painful days , but she was painful when this study in the 1990s was conducted in the 1990s .
they were asked to to report every 60 seconds to report on their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they will be asked , &quot; who has suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain that had a patient , and more .
but now there &apos;s a different question : &quot; how much did these patients that they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a a much worse <unk> of the <unk> , as a patient b.
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story , as it ends .
and none of those stories is very <unk> or wonderful -- but one of them is that ...
but one of them is worse than the other .
and the , the worse is the , the thing was the , which was at the end of its peak , it &apos;s a terrible story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to their <unk> , and also , &quot; how bad was all of all of it ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a b. in the <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the <unk> , b. itself has a bad time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments done , and it &apos;s made , and it works , you could just put the <unk> of the patient &apos;s just by just holding it down with it without very much to him .
that &apos;s going to lead the patient &apos;s suffering , but just a bit less than before .
and if you make it a few minutes , you have to make the <unk> self &apos;s a bad and you have to have the <unk> of the <unk> itself , because now you have a a better story about its experience .
what is a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that makes us to memory and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
and so a story of <unk> are transforming , significant moments and end .
end are very , very important , and in this case , it &apos;s the end .
well , the <unk> itself lives lives .
it has moments of the <unk> , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re all lost forever .
i mean most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve got the thing to do -- you know , the psychological present , and what does you know that there are about 600 million of them . and in a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 .
most of you are completely ignored by the <unk> self .
and yet , you kind of get the impression that you should be counting , that what happens during that moments of the media &apos;s happened .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use as we &apos;re on the world .
and as we use it , seemingly important , but it &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> itself .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the time .
in view of the <unk> self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is that as well as the first , then the <unk> vacation is twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
so that doesn &apos;t work for the <unk> self .
for the <unk> itself , a <unk> vacation is hardly better than the <unk> vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories of being added .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , the critical variable is actually the critical variable that is a <unk> of a <unk> self , and time has very little influence on this story .
now , the <unk> self makes more than to remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that &apos;s making decisions , because if you have a patient , who we say two <unk> at two different surgeons and decides what he &apos;s choosing , that &apos;s the the person who &apos;s being selected .
the <unk> itself doesn &apos;t have a voice in that election .
we actually don &apos;t choose to do between experience , and we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about the future , not as a experience .
we think about our future , the <unk> memories of .
and basically , you can see that , you know , as a tyranny of the <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> self as one that sort of the <unk> self in experience that the <unk> itself doesn &apos;t need .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re a vacation that is , that &apos;s what we &apos;re on vacation , on the service of the <unk> itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much <unk> we are about ?
this is one of the explanations that will be given for the domination of the <unk> .
and if i think about it , i think about a vacation that we &apos;ve made a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think , i think , in the relationship , as often i often think about other <unk> .
and i &apos;ve probably been thinking of my memories of this <unk> journey , i would say , about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i &apos;ve ever spent the &quot; the &quot; the <unk> , with the 600 pictures of that i would have spent an extra hour .
well , that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s just about a half hours .
there seems to be an <unk> .
well , i may be a little extreme , you know , in it , i have the <unk> of memory , but even if you &apos;re doing more of that , you know , if you &apos;re doing more weight in the <unk> of the weight that we give ?
so i want you to think about a thought thought about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday you know that at the end of the <unk> , all of the their pictures are being <unk> and get them to a <unk> drug that you will remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you &apos;d choose to a holiday , there is a conflict between the of the self and you have to think about how they don &apos;t decide that conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of you , you might think of the sense of you think of the memory you might get a different answer .
why we choose to choose the <unk> , which is a problem that &apos;s a problem that &apos;s a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two species of the self are just like to take two concepts from happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use a per self .
so you can ask , how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then they would ask , how happy are the moments in life of the <unk> self ?
and they are all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of happiness itself over time .
if you &apos;re lucky to the happiness of the <unk> self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not about how happy person lives lives .
it &apos;s what happy or delighted to be , the person is when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
now , everybody who are not different from exploring the happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being that have these days in happiness for happiness , in the same way .
the distinction between happiness itself and the happiness is the <unk> itself has been recognized in the last years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two of the <unk> .
the gallup organization has a global survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences . and there were others in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of the two species of self .
and the main lesson that we , i think , learn , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone who is to his life , and it doesn &apos;t tell you much about how happy he lives lives and the other way .
just to give you a sense of correlation with a correlation that is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you &apos;d meet someone and you would say you , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his greatness ?
well , you &apos;d know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone who are like eight to a scale than eight on a scale , you have much uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something that &apos;s based on the <unk> .
we know that money is very important , destinations are very important .
we know that happiness is being happy with people who we like to do time with people who we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so , if you &apos;re going to maximize the the of the two species of yourself , they will do very different things at the end .
and the conclusion that i said , what i said here is that we &apos;re really not to imagine a <unk> replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very quickly , another reason we &apos;re not thinking about happiness is that we &apos;re not going to look at the same things that we think about life and if we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you think that question , you have to be happier in california , if you say , we have to live in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that &apos;s what we say , in climate .
well it turns out that climate is not very important to the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
but now , because the <unk> itself is responsible , can you end up -- some people could pull out to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to what happens to people who are moving to california , to be happier .
well , your <unk> self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think that you &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you will remember it , like terrible the weather in ohio , and they feel that they have the right thing to do the right thing .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of that i think about how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we were talking about a few weeks ago , i told me that there was a pretty interesting conclusion that came out of the gallup poll .
is that something that you can do with us because you &apos;ve got a couple of minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most exciting thing that we found in the gallup survey that we found in the gallup survey that we &apos;ve absolutely never expected to find absolutely .
we found that in terms of the <unk> self .
and if we looked at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that under income income in income , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of american , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a $ 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in year , people are unhappy unhappy , and they will become more less less than the poorer they are .
and we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen so flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money doesn &apos;t reconcile a <unk> , but that lack of money will be miserable , and we can be miserable , and we can measure it very , very clear .
in the spirit of the other self , the <unk> self , you get a different story .
the more money you deserve , you have become happier .
it &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american endeavor , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
when people would take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to be all over the head , everything we think about , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians that the country will generally take a <unk> <unk> how to take the seriously and that ?
<unk> : you know , i believe that it &apos;s an recognition for the role of the <unk> in politics .
and it &apos;s going to be slow to the united states , not a question , but in the u.k. , they &apos;re going on and in other countries .
people are in the words that you should think of happiness , if you think of politics .
it will take a while , and the people will be able to explore whether you want to explore a <unk> or whether you want to explore immorality , so we have to be this discussion pretty much pretty soon .
as you can increase happiness , can be very different depending on how they think and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> self .
that will change politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you &apos;re looking at the most vulnerable of the population .
that &apos;s going to think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this topic , or should be at least the most interesting political debate for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been <unk> now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade , it &apos;s just as easy to save the world in reality , as it is to save in <unk> .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them , to play more time with play more and more demeaning games .
now , we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little bit of time when you think how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but actually , my research at the institute of the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week , are not nearly enough enough to solve the most most most important problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we want to have that time dramatically .
i &apos;ve calculated that the required that the need to spend a time at 21 billion hours of a week .
that seems to be a little bit , so , so i &apos;ll let it work with it : if we &apos;re problems with the world of hunger , poverty , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to do play online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade hours a week .
no , i really mean , i mean , really seriously .
why ? this image describes pretty exactly why i believe that games are so essential for survival of the human species in the future .
this is a tudor portrait of phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the feelings of playing , so he &apos;s built a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may have some of the nuances of nuances in this image .
you probably see that sense of urgency , something fear , but also great concentration , very deep , very deep , very much deep to solving a real difficult problem .
if you play , you see , some of nuances here , the <unk> eyes and the mouth are a marker of optimism . the <unk> of surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s called the <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so , so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result , which is so good , that it &apos;s not possible at all that it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , you &apos;re shocked to actually something like that , that &apos;s a <unk> victory .
this is a short before a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of <unk> around the world , if we take the the the the the the the back the back of the next century , the face of which , the last <unk> are on the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more thinking of this face in real life , if we &apos;re facing difficult problems .
i call it as &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m like &quot; in life i &apos;m bad for <unk> .
this is one graffiti in my former my former california , california , where i was examined in my ph.d. , why we &apos;re in in my ph.d. , why we &apos;re better than living in real life .
that &apos;s a problem that &apos;s a lot players .
we think we &apos;re not as good as in the reality .
and i don &apos;t just have a lot less , although that &apos;s what it is .
we &apos;re getting more more <unk> . i &apos;m going to do with the relationship with the motivation , to do something more , to engage with each other .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i think many of us will transform in our best version , at all , and at least immediately , <unk> the problem is to try to try it to the way that would try to try it again .
and in reality , if we &apos;re failing , when we hit in obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we &apos;re numb with us , we &apos;re threatened by ourselves , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these sentiments we never have , if we play games in games , it just doesn &apos;t .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a student student .
why is it possible to be in games , to think , you could not just achieve anything ?
how can we transfer those sentiments into reality ?
so i started looking like the world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment to collaborative problem-solving problem .
and i &apos;ve seen some things that are going to be in the <unk> <unk> .
so , first , if you get in one of these <unk> , especially at the world of warcraft , there are lots of different characters that are willing to give you a <unk> mission , and that &apos;s immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission to fit perfect on your current level , right ?
so , do it .
you never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
but always at the edge of their abilities , so they have to work on , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and <unk> . there &apos;s always important to do something important .
and there are lots of collaborators .
where they also go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to go to their epic mission .
that &apos;s not just just that easy , that feeling that at a <unk> of <unk> infected with a <unk> of staff .
and also , there &apos;s this epic epic story , this inspiring story , why we are and what we &apos;ve done .
and then we get this positive feedback .
they &apos;re supposed to have a level up , &quot; and &quot; + a <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> 1 intelligence . &quot;
that time is not in the real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t like to talk about a <unk> and <unk> a crazy idea , &quot; + 20 crazy idea .
i get not going to get this feedback in the real life .
so , the problem of the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be a lot of <unk> <unk> , that we would rather than spend our time in this time .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> has spent millions of years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound .
but to see the context of seeing the , <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> started to go upright .
so the first step in the .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we &apos;re working with play , that just makes sense of when you &apos;re looking at the time in terms of the scale of human evolution in the face of the world &apos;s extremely .
but also appropriate . because it turns out , by putting these whole time to play , actually actually change what we &apos;re in .
we &apos;re developing collaborative thinking , so i have a lot of things .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
so , look at this interesting statistic , the recently of carnegie mellon in carnegie mellon , who was released , the average boy of being in a country with tremendous <unk> spends 10,000 hours of <unk> for <unk> for 21 hours of year .
so , 10,000 hours , is a very interesting number , two reasons .
first , for children in the united states , <unk> hours of the precise <unk> that they spend in school , from the five class to the high school -- if you don &apos;t have any .
so , we have a complete <unk> , which is the young people as well , what it means to be a good player , how do anything you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so , you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the <unk> research that , if we spend 10,000 hours with a <unk> in any subject to the 21st of year , we will be trained to master .
we &apos;re going to be good at whatever , whatever the most significant people in the world .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the great players are good ? &quot;
because if we could find that figure out , we &apos;ve never been there before the potential of potential .
so many people we have in the world at least one hour a day with a <unk> day .
this is our <unk> , 500 million people who are extraordinarily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade we have a billion players who are exceptional in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it .
the <unk> is designed to save energy and work on a <unk> , instead of the <unk> , so that players all around the world , especially in india , china , china , can play online .
you would expect to be a billion player in the next decade .
so that &apos;s a total number billion players .
so i started to think about what it is to do to do with these games .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first of the things i found .
ok , imagine it &apos;s like the extreme <unk> of .
<unk> is the desire to do something immediately to do a a a a a a a a a a a a a successful hope to success .
players believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s worth the way it to try and try and it &apos;s right .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the spiders of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that shows we like to do people , after we &apos;ve played with you , even if they defeated us .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust with someone to play a game .
we trust that someone has time with us that the rules will be <unk> that we have the same goal and to stay with it .
so the <unk> of the <unk> is to trust from bonds , trust and each other .
and as a result , we build a stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> <unk> a week , sort of a as a <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happier , we &apos;re actually happier , to work , when we don &apos;t do anything .
we know that we &apos;re going to be optimal , as we do hard , significant work .
and players are ready to work hard when you get the right job .
and finally , the second step .
players love it , part of the <unk> of the race .
here &apos;s a <unk> to the right light , and you know all wikipedia , the most of the , the most of the .
the second of the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people , it &apos;s going to use it every month .
they &apos;ve been compiling more information about the world of warcraft in the internet than any other subject in any other .
they create a <unk> epic story .
they create a <unk> source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so that &apos;s four superpowers who are to a single result , players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as a single world .
and the only thing is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real real .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to be a witnesses from not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i do , i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> .
so he says that makes sense that makes sense , because players can achieve more more than living in real life .
they can make more powerful social ties in a real life , and they get more feedback and reward in games than in real life .
so he says , it &apos;s completely logical that player are more time in the virtual world as in the real world .
i just just to do that , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that 2,500 years of <unk> .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> , you know ?
there was a fantastic <unk> of <unk> , there was <unk> .
and that was sort of the first of people developed developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the <unk> greek <unk> , you may know this story , and the story about how to play .
according to <unk> , games were actually invented in the kingdom of famine during famine .
it was that great famine , the king of <unk> decided to a crazy idea .
people who fought . people fighting .
it was a extreme situation . it needed a big solution .
so they invented , loud , the <unk> and <unk> a national strategy , and a day , you would eat , and the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re so fascinating and with <unk> , <unk> productivity so that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , it was so 18 years of that famine , she had to ate this famine , and they played the next .
so , just as , i think , let &apos;s play in games today .
we &apos;re playing games to get out of the real world .
we &apos;re playing games to all of the to avoid all the real world , particularly it &apos;s not satisfying in real life , and we &apos;re bringing us what we need to play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to 18 years , the famine years , he was not better , so , and the king , one last <unk> <unk> .
they divided the archimedes in two camps .
they were a <unk> , and the best was allowed to create an <unk> adventure .
they left <unk> and did a search for a new home , and they &apos;d just leave a lot of people to survive , and they were looking for the rest after an area where they could flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest thing show that the <unk> , which was the <unk> that were the the same dna as the old <unk> .
and so scientists came to the notion that the <unk> <unk> was actually true .
and geologists found evidence a global <unk> , who took about the <unk> of what was happening to the famine .
so this was that crazy story .
maybe they actually have saved their people through play , by giving themselves for 18 years in games , and then they had these <unk> <unk> , and then they &apos;ve got that much of these <unk> , and so much about these , they &apos;ve saved the entire civilization of civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing with all of los .
this was the first <unk> in real time of <unk> , and that was 16 years ago .
they were <unk> for 18 years , we &apos;ve been running all of all of all of all of years .
i &apos;d like to argue , we &apos;re willing to play for our own .
so they sent half of their civilization to find a new world , so i take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should be able to have the half of us a day with a day to play the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in play ? &quot; and exactly that question i &apos;ve devoted to my work in the last few years at the institute of the future .
we &apos;ve got this banner in palo alto , it &apos;s out how to understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is the future .
we want to introduce the best possible outcome , and then people make it to make this idea in reality .
we &apos;re going to be <unk> , and give people the possibilities to get them .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly about three games that i designed to try and try to get people &apos;s review in their own future .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
the game is in 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> that you have to have to have to cross a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it &apos;s realistic for it , and they actually live real life without life . so if you &apos;re going to play about it , you know , you know , about it , you know , about it , you know , about it , you know , about it , you know , you know
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 <unk> in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been joined it since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should be .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventures and they said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re about .
find out how they would survive , most of our players have the in the game of habits .
so we have a bigger game for the next <unk> game , more and higher target than just a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game called &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute for the future .
and what &apos;s starting to start is the calculation of a <unk> , that the people only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , of course .
the call to the players , and the <unk> , we &apos;ve made almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
they know jerry <unk> , where they have &quot; <unk> , &quot; they &apos;ve got astronauts , the scientists who <unk> the <unk> and and they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just 5 people , say , everyone is in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job to create the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played this game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read , if you google &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game , we took on march three , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you wrap the game game , you get the <unk> &apos;s award , the <unk> of the world bank , at the end of 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in sub-saharan africa , and they store a social learning .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high to the <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and genius .
i &apos;d like to invite you to share this game with young people , all over the world , particularly in <unk> , who are the benefit to to do their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;ll come to the end .
i want to ask you about something .
what do you think is going to be next ?
we &apos;ve got all these fantastic players , we play that we can show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with me that the players are the resources that we can actually put in real life , and that games have a big meaning of change .
we &apos;ve got these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to engage with a strong social networks , and they desire to <unk> meaning .
and i really hope that we play a major games to survive on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with these play and play .
now , if i <unk> myself , i &apos;m sure about two things , i &apos;m sure that we can create a future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start to play the <unk> games !
thank you .
i would like to tell you something that a few months ago in writing a article on the national reputation of wired .
i &apos;ve always been writing my <unk> at the end , but i was with the work of text , and i realized that i &apos;ve never been in my life , which is the word &quot; disabled &quot;
i &apos;ll read the one .
&quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , weak and weak .
<unk> : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend loud , and he had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i was just to <unk> down until , and i had to take it out after that <unk> <unk> and so <unk> <unk> .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , <unk> , and i just thought that the issue is already pretty old .
but actually , it was a braille in the early &apos; 80s , when i was talking about elementary school , and i started to create my self from my family circle , and in terms of other children and the rest of the rest of the world around me .
and god is , thank you , i didn &apos;t use a <unk> .
i would take seriously take this one , i was born in a world who can be positive in a way that can be positive in any positive way , but today , i &apos;m going to be the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately navigated to the most of 2009 , and i expected to find a <unk> spot .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , she &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people who describe this with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greeks and the romans , really believed that the pronunciation of a <unk> has a big force because what you &apos;re looking at loud , even though .
so , what do we want to do is a <unk> -- one disabled people or a healthy people ?
let &apos;s have a people to call a child as a child , you could counter , and <unk> them ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be fun to open doors ?
a person who opened for me , my pediatrician was at a <unk> researcher <unk> institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> whose name , how you can think , most americans don &apos;t have to be correct , so he &apos;s been called dr. p. .
and dr. p. used to fly and was just like this work with children like this .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> .
i had to do a separate <unk> of these things to do with this big , elastic <unk> -- in different colors -- that &apos;s what you know , to build my <unk> , and i hated that tapes , and i hated it . i hated her . i hated her .
and imagine , i &apos;ve actually been talking to a <unk> child with dr. p. and trying to stop these exercises without success .
and one day he was watching me in my practicing -- these were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , aimee , you &apos;re so a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll tear one day one day one day .
and if you can create it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was just a simple trick by dr. p. , so i do the exercises that i didn &apos;t want to do with the face that the middle-class middle-class middle-class <unk> <unk> in the clinic and <unk> me to see my daily <unk> with new eyes . so it became a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder today , how much of me a powerful and powerful young young girl had shaped my self and , and i could imagine myself as a nature of nature , powerful powerful and <unk> human .
that &apos;s just one example of how adults can be able to achieve the imagination of a child .
but as the most compelling examples of the <unk> , doesn &apos;t make us a room to imagine what we all would want to want to want to do : to anyone to see themselves as powerful people as powerful people .
our language is the social changes in which in many cases , which has been triggered by a technological change .
from the medical perspective , of course , you can say , my legs , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> from titan and artificial <unk> for aging bodies that allow people to use and they &apos;re going to <unk> to groups that you &apos;re themselves .
so maybe this thing really is the clearer change because the one of truth , that there was a different truth , which is that every human being a very powerful and very powerful , and that the human capacity to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human capacity to adapt -- that &apos;s a interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you about , and i &apos;m going to say , that sentence has never been very uncomfortable for me , and i think , i think , i think , i understand why .
this one sentence from the learning is is that success or happiness depends on , to be a challenge without having to become a challenge with a prosthetic , or whatever my life would be as successful , or whatever people can feel me with my disability .
but the truth is that we change us , of course , we &apos;re in the challenge of , whether they &apos;re physically , emotional or even both of them .
and i &apos;d like to argue that that &apos;s good .
there &apos;s no obstacle that we have to have to have to have to be able to get to our lives better .
liespotters are just a <unk> of our lives .
and i tend to see a lot of <unk> as a shadow .
sometimes i realize that it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s very <unk> , but he &apos;s all the time .
and i want to do that by no , the impact on the <unk> of a human <unk> .
there are the world &apos;s <unk> and challenges , and they are just real real and every person &apos;s real , but the question is not , whether we &apos;re not going to come with <unk> or not how we get to it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for that , people who we love to preserve <unk> , but it &apos;s going to prepare for it to be clear .
and we don &apos;t like to have our kids , if we give them feel that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to clear two things : to be an medical fact , to be an patient , and to the other social people that i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and sustained disability that i had to put down with the world , she can describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are at the heart and you &apos;re telling you the cool , to say , the hard truth of life that you expect , we need to be careful that we &apos;re actually not going to get the opportunity to do that we &apos;re actually disabled .
maybe the current concept , which is just what it &apos;s broken , and how we repair the repair for each one more disability than the brain live in the brain .
if we don &apos;t treat humans from humans , and not all its forces and and acknowledge , we create in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to have to have another disease .
we &apos;re a human people who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the <unk> , and we have to focus on all the scope of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> , and a connection .
we should not have to <unk> those <unk> times or not we shouldn &apos;t avoid them , nor should you go under the rug , but it &apos;s about to recognize the most successful opportunity .
and i think it &apos;s about to realize that we don &apos;t necessarily have to have to have to keep <unk> , but that we &apos;re open to hug a <unk> , and you can use a <unk> <unk> for the time to use a <unk> , and maybe even dancing with it .
and maybe we can do it , <unk> than something natural , <unk> and useful , and feel that way through their presence , that &apos;s not inflicted by their presence .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin has written in my eyes , in my eyes , in a very true of human character .
i would rearrange it this way : not the most powerful of its way , and not the <unk> of its way , but the <unk> of the things that can adapt to the best .
it &apos;s about conflicts of creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , that the capacity of people to survive and <unk> , from the struggle of human spirit , determines by conflicts .
so , again , change and <unk> are the greatest of the human qualities .
and maybe we know , we know what wood is we &apos;re tested by that , if we &apos;re actually tested .
and perhaps , is the sense of <unk> , a sense of the <unk> , a sense of our own force .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give a new meaning that &apos;s about severe times .
maybe we can see a change as a change .
<unk> are a change that we haven &apos;t have to have to have .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve been to have to have to be normal .
and honestly , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical . but not the normal , and would you want to learn that arms , gray person , really want to learn if they were really ?
i think , rather than not .
it would be great if we &apos;re going to the paradigm of normal , or the starch , to make it even a little bit more dangerous to formulate , and they invite you to bring the power of very many of kids and make them in their very special and valuable skills to society .
<unk> found out that we have people from members of our society , and they needed to be useful and to do a piece .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals were faced with people who were carrying people with heavy with severe physical injuries and that might be done because the <unk> of the <unk> of these people in the <unk> of these people in the society was valuable .
they don &apos;t have these people as they damage , and they were considered something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went in the city where i grew up in a <unk> in the middle of pennsylvania , and i was there a <unk> tomato .
it was summer , and i had a <unk> .
and i hear , like a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and see , and see these older man . i didn &apos;t know who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , you know , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re not going to remember me .
when i first saw her , i was her her mother . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it &apos;s actually , but it &apos;s done .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who i knew i had to know , i knew about my mother about this day because i of course , to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> medical diagnostics was in holiday , and that &apos;s how my parents brought me to the world , at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet were going to me , and i had some toes of that and a couple of toes in the other foot , he had the <unk> , who was the <unk> of the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and you could have to be able to be a self-sufficient life , and then they just have me lie <unk> . &quot;
really , really , i found that he had collected a whole childhood , i &apos;ve won &apos;t have a <unk> in the second grade , whether i had the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and the <unk> medical school and the medical school medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> , the x factor , the potential of human will be .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how the quality of quality can be a human possible .
and dr. <unk> said , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if they don &apos;t get something else , and even if you get kids to do , and then you get kids to do a lot of time , then kids can reach very much . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed his way .
he understood that medical diagnosis and how someone comes to it , two different things .
and i think , in course , my thinking changed the time , if you had asked me to the <unk> of legs against legs , and i had no second <unk> .
i was really trying to be normal .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite the experience .
and perhaps that change , that change , because i &apos;ve been in a lot of people who have left doors , instead of having people who have me my my <unk> or an idea of <unk> .
see , it really need a person who demonstrate you how to give their power , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to turn your own , on the control -- the human spirit is so <unk> -- if you can do it , and you &apos;re a door for someone in a particular moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the <unk> roots &quot; origins &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot;
it means something that is in a , the potential is potential .
again : what potential do we want to do ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , in the u.k. , in the u.k. , was transformed into <unk> .
they call that there &quot; <unk> <unk> in the united states , we call it as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are going to be .
and the a student will be tested <unk> <unk> , get the better teachers .
and they have a <unk> period of time with a &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was very good , &quot; they were <unk> that they were very clever , and after that three months , she wrote a <unk> .
and of course , it breaks to a heart , the other thing that the the <unk> was told , they were just enough .
and it &apos;s just the same time after three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except by the students who had the school .
very critical in this study was that teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
and they just told that , the <unk> , and that &apos;s the students with the grade , and they just taught them something and treated them .
the only real disability is a mind mind a mind that has broken , has no hope more <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and our <unk> capacity to imagination .
but if we can do it , the human spirit , to support itself , and to hope themselves and other people around their own way , and <unk> and <unk> , we can actually put our power to a positive .
if a spirit of these qualities have , we can create a new reality and new organizational .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet named <unk> by the 14th <unk> , and by my friend jacques <unk> , and the poem is &quot; the god knows , &quot; you know , come with me . &quot;
come , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you be better than they &apos;re currently ?
suppose i said that , through a few changes of their genes , a better memory , more precisely , more deeply and faster .
or you want to be more <unk> , more force .
do you want to be more attractive and more confidence ?
how would it be longer in a good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who are always going to be more of more creativity .
which would you like most ?
which would you like to have , if you could just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose to have ?
put your hands . let me see me .
a few . probably , probably about how many of these creative people here are creative people .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you decide to make a good memory ?
a couple more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to do , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is it just a a conceit ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a <unk> issue here in the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s view of a doctor &apos;s view .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , a a paper called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense of itself from the <unk> of evolution . &quot;
well , if you &apos;re one of those who are not to accept the evidence of biology , that would be a very good moment , you take your personal <unk> -- you &apos;ll take you for permission -- and you might give you the <unk> -- and you might give you the permission -- and you might give you the permission -- and you might give you the
but if you accept a biological evolution , remember this : it &apos;s just about the past , or is it &apos;s about the future ?
is it for other <unk> or it &apos;s also for us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , all the <unk> of the the branches of the twigs , they have survive ; it creates a <unk> , and it makes a strength .
the human part of this <unk> , but , of course , is that what we &apos;re most interested in most .
we are a lot of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees , about six or eight million years .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 different types of hominids , maybe maybe 20 or 25 .
some have come and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we &apos;re right to the other parts of the tree of life , but actually the biggest part , are the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are pretty much .
is clear that we can use it and can make the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human protein that uses it &apos;s using <unk> diabetic ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically <unk> from what &apos;s the pancreas .
and where we &apos;ve heard about bacteria , is that each of us in our gut is more bacteria than the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times a .
i mean , think if antonio damasio &apos;s asked to wonder , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to all nutrients that they could just want to be without a effort .
it &apos;s really a lightweight easier for bacteria , with occasional <unk> <unk> of unintended , forced pressure to the exits .
but you know , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are important for their lives .
they &apos;re helping to <unk> by genes , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a form of <unk> balance in form of a species ?
or are we &apos;re being able to become something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
let &apos;s now back back in the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first form of creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago -- and then the human species that are going to shape in the last year after the last year after the last year after the last year after
in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is just measuring the animal animal animal , like a single stroke , and the human life , a little <unk> of <unk> .
we were .
this is also the <unk> of this talk , so i hope , in fact , have it in the way .
now , when i was a <unk> of the college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the force of evolution , and i posed something very fundamental : most of life in organisms , all of the cell , and all the genetic information that will be on both of the two <unk> .
but at the time , as a <unk> organisms , it started to change things .
sexual reproduction is coming into the picture .
and critically , to the introduction of sexual reproduction that the genome is going to be <unk> the rest of the body .
in fact , you might say that the <unk> of the body of our body is in the same moment as the sexual reproduction .
now i have to say , when i was a <unk> , , okay , sex / death , a sex -- it seemed pretty sensible to the time , but with every year , it &apos;s been to my increased opportunity to my increased .
i &apos;ve come to see the feelings of george burns , who in las vegas in las vegas in las in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a beautifully <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful &quot; &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i was a a doctor that i was a goal that was a different goal of evolution -- not necessarily a reminder of a different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to restore the health of a disease .
i wanted to make a long and healthy lives .
evolution is all about the legacy of the genome to the next generation , transforming and survival generation .
from a evolutionary perspective , you and i designed to make a <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage of orbit to go into the ocean .
i think we would all the mood , the woody of the explanations , as he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to reach immortality through my work .
i want to do it by being not going to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily have the longest life to be .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily have the biggest ones , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test test and success is the test .
on the reason of the ocean , bacteria are there , and they &apos;re going to have the hot <unk> , because they were <unk> , it &apos;s made a <unk> <unk> fish that they &apos;ve managed to do it there .
so what does that mean , if we look back on what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place in evolution , and how we &apos;re going to do in the next stage , i would say that there are a series of opportunity .
the first is we &apos;re not going to evolve .
we &apos;ve achieved a kind of balance .
and the reasons that would be that it &apos;s us to have a first through medicine , we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that were otherwise <unk> and from the population .
and secondly , we as a species , we have our environment so that it &apos;s going to be in us and so we &apos;re going to adapt to them .
and by the way , we travel and and mix together so much that they can &apos;t say , that isolation is necessary for evolution , to <unk> .
a second opportunity is that it will be a evolution of the traditional type , of course , imposed from the forces of nature .
and the argument here is that the wheels of evolution are slow , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so , as isolation , if we colonize a species distance , it will be insulation and the changes of the environment that could create evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third opportunity , a <unk> , fascinating and scary .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that &apos;s not simply , but led to us as a <unk> in the decisions we do .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s see the reality that people are doing today in some cultures make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family .
so if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the sex of your child , but also the body of genetic adaptations , to heal disease and prevent disease .
what if you could do the genetic changes to eliminating diabetes or alzheimer or alzheimer or alzheimer &apos;s disease or not reduce the average of risk or unnecessary ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do this change in their genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost billion dollars .
and the next year , when it was finished , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> until four months .
today , you can now have a sequence of three billion base base base of the human genome to a price of about $ $ $ 20,000 and in the room of a week .
it won &apos;t take longer long until the reality is that it will be the $ 1,000 dollars human genomes , and it will be increasingly available to everyone .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the <unk> prize prize and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , who are independent , and to <unk> proteins in a more effective than what warning argued &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
a few years ago , the <unk> of the scientist was awarded to a <unk> scientist , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , and by manipulation of just four genes , the cell induced to an <unk> cell cell , to be potentially any cell in your body .
these changes in the coming .
the same technology that makes the human insulin to bacteria that not only protect itself in itself , but also the immunity against other viruses .
if you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with vaccine that has been grown in the cells of a food factory .
can you imagine a good thing , that made of tobacco ?
this is all reality , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
so , imagine just two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if you could change sperm and <unk> or the <unk> of <unk> , to give their children better chance to give a better chance of a <unk> life -- eliminating diabetes , the <unk> , the risk of cancer ?
who would not be a healthier ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can enable change to prevent disease , we could also adopt to adopt <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- that &apos;s better memory .
why don &apos;t have the <unk> of a ken <unk> , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of the <unk> ?
why not the fast <unk> , they will enable them to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re at a point where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be converted by <unk> evolution .
we will have a process that requires 100 years , and we can compress it on a thousand years -- and maybe even even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , to be .
do we use to make a society that is better , that is more more friendly ?
or will we be selectively different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to have a society form and <unk> , or more effective and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to be facing .
and most of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom that we are going to need to make this make this decisions ?
in high-performing in the , and as you might think , as you might think , they will make these decisions .
thank you .
i want you to imagine now a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or another one , the <unk> of helping to stand up and go to go and go .
so , at berkeley <unk> call these robots .
they &apos;re not different than anything that they put in the morning and attach them to the pace and that it will be increasing and help you to keep your balance for example .
that &apos;s indeed the case of human being , and machine .
but not only that -- and merging together , and then , and connect with the universe and other devices .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now , to show you now , what we &apos;re working on , we start to talk about the american soldiers who carries about 100 pounds on its back and it &apos;s the request you should be more equipment .
of course , this leads to several major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we &apos;d take us to take us this challenge and create a <unk> that would help with this problem with this problem .
so let me introduce you to you now -- or the human universal <unk> <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can carry 200 pounds over a <unk> of a long hours .
it &apos;s a flexible design enables it to be deep deep , to crawl , and highly <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to go and get to get my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re so far to visualize this device with our <unk> of this device , this new <unk> .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s take our look at the coaches , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are in the the world &apos;s invested in the wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s indeed an conservative estimation .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people in the <unk> of the <unk> who were in the most of their life -- -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 40s -- from the fate of the and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , their number <unk> .
and so much option -- if it comes to a <unk> , or or the other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , it &apos;s been for 500 years , and it &apos;s been , as a few years , as i say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter .
now let me now imagine a <unk> that is being carried on a <unk> who had a <unk> <unk> who has been a result that they couldn &apos;t walk over 19 years and until now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda , <unk> <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors on the crutches , the signals on our <unk> , which is attached to her back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips as well as on their <unk> , they move forward in this pretty granular and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , while a <unk> <unk> <unk> me .
a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my <unk> .
not a long time , a doctor in my <unk> and he said , &quot; amanda , you will never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
it &apos;s a steel every <unk> hope of my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been to learn to go to the <unk> , to climb , and even with the hands bike bike .
but nothing was invented to me again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms that we have the platforms to meet us and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we &apos;ve got the potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for amanda , or amanda , and for amanda , and for all the users .
thank you .
in new york , i &apos;m a head of the <unk> director of a non-profit organization called the director called the director .
if i didn &apos;t see the poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> in a volunteer , a volunteer <unk> of the fire .
well , in our city , in the volunteers , in the volunteers , in the volunteers , to be a <unk> <unk> , which is to be a very early on the <unk> to <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer of the <unk> , so i had a very good opportunity to be able to do .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to achieve the <unk> and figure out what our work would be .
when i found the <unk> , he had just a very serious conversation with the <unk> , which was certainly one of the most horrifying days of her life .
it was in the middle of night and she stood up in the <unk> and barefoot under a umbrella outside the rain , and her house in flames .
the other volunteers who was just on to me , we call it <unk> luther -- reached the <unk> of the first and was asked to go to the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was <unk> .
there was some lawyer or <unk> , who was now for the rest of his life , and he was able to get a living in a house house , only because it was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me to himself .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
they have to go up to the fire , and you have to get this woman &apos;s shoes . &quot;
i swear to swear .
now , not exactly what i hope was to hope , but i went up to the hallway that <unk> the <unk> , which was the real &quot; <unk> , the <unk> of the time in the bedroom , to get a pair of shoes .
i know what you think now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back to where i was in the front door my <unk> and i met the dog .
we put our treasures out to the <unk> , where , not surprising , who was much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the <unk> got a letter of the <unk> that she was for the brave trains in the house of saving her house .
one of all valued <unk> , somebody had a <unk> pair of shoes .
and both in my job in the hood as a as a as a writer as a as a writer , i witnessed by generosity and <unk> at great scale , but i also see the charity and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they all are important .
so if i see in this room , and people who have achieved a <unk> success or on your way there , i want to offer that memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t you don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the lives of a different , until they have to the first one .
if you give something to give you something , you &apos;ll give it .
they &apos;re using them in a residential orchard , putting a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , a chance of giving us to save a person , but every day offers us to change one .
so they go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , you go back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just back to a community that knows the secret of the human race .
a place where the women lead to the <unk> , with sex &apos; hello , and the game is destined to be a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees with our closest living .
that means we have a common ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
now , chimps are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees , the <unk> of great , fears will be led , the <unk> of <unk> female .
they really have this up because this leads to a very <unk> society in the fatal violence that has been seen .
but unfortunately , the other known is the most known among the primates .
they live in the depths of the <unk> , and the observation is just hard to it .
congo is a paradox -- a country of exceptional diverse diverse and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the svalbard a a violent argument that has been used for decades of the world war ii .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction are also the survival of the bonobos .
<unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , that you don &apos;t even have a stadium with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> smile that the trees hits .
who are these related ?
we know , as &quot; love instead of war , because they have <unk> , including sex , with <unk> partners , and rules and social <unk> .
i don &apos;t say that , that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because life is made of more than the <unk> of the <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love it , to play their lives long .
play is not just <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s essential to the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
and we learn to trust and the rules of the game .
play is interconnected and resilience and resilience , and it &apos;s about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you watch bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> of the <unk> of us .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i &apos;d like to show you some unique footage straight from the wild .
first one <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here &apos;s a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
that might be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; it puts him to eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s kind of like , right .
yeah !
so <unk> are common , both in the bonobos as well as well as people .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting because it shows the <unk> of that you get to play with new elements into play -- like the <unk> -- and it &apos;s pretty fun for the same time .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> and it can assume many forms of which some little bit disturbing , <unk> , curious about -- maybe to discover the surprise again .
and i &apos;d like to show you , that is a <unk> female , and she &apos;s got peacefully with water .
i think , just like you &apos;re going to play with sometimes , and we &apos;re extending the limitations of our inner worlds .
and it &apos;s the playful curiosity that makes us make us , and interact with and the unexpected way that we are , are real breeding of creativity .
this is just a little <unk> of <unk> on the insights , the bonobos give us to our past and present .
but it also a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to the narrow challenges , through greater creativity and social labor system .
the secret is that the key is to the skills of the skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
to adapt to a hyper-connected world , we need to play .
but will we make the best of our <unk> ?
play is not very much .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people alike are not just the <unk> and claws .
just if it seems to appropriate , maybe it seems to be a <unk> .
and so my favorite thing , let &apos;s adopt this gift of evolution and together , while we <unk> the creativity and <unk> <unk> .
thank you .
i want you to introduce two pairs , in 1979 , which is exactly the same day , every single <unk> of a baby -- all the <unk> .
so two pairs , every <unk> , every single baby .
now i don &apos;t want to take you too much time to imagine the <unk> , because if you think of the time you think of the time you &apos;re not listening to me .
now , imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case that triggers a <unk> <unk> , which is on the x chromosome of the <unk> .
and in the other case , the sperm sperm sperm that meets the x chromosome in the <unk> .
both of them are <unk> , both fire .
we &apos;re still going back to these people later .
most of my activities , i have two hats in the time .
under a hat , i &apos;m with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m studied <unk> , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- meaning , meaning , the human body -- like it with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , how she thought about the body .
the other hat i &apos;ve carried in my work , the activist , as a <unk> -- or , as i say , as an inflatable lawyer -- by people who are patients from doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people who have the social norms of the question .
so i &apos;ve been working with people who are the most infected , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were the little as usual .
and i often , i &apos;ve worked with <unk> people whose gender <unk> is -- so people who have the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word of using the word .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll give you a couple examples of the kinds of examples that are not the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of y leaves the <unk> that we &apos;ve all got to <unk> <unk> .
and so , testicles on testosterone at the phone stage .
but because that individual is missing receptors to see the branches , the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
so , there &apos;s a lot of testosterone , but not a reaction to it .
as a result , the body develops more of typical female course , and that &apos;s the same time .
when the child is born , they look like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as girls .
but it takes most of them to the puberty and their breasts , they develop , but not their period , until someone comes to that there is something else .
and they do a few tests and find that instead of <unk> and uterus , in fact , they have a y chromosome .
and so it &apos;s important to understand that you could be a male person for actually a male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something in our bodies , they called <unk> .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the <unk> <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most women , as i -- i think i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real <unk> , but i think i think i actually have the typical -- most women like me are actually in <unk> .
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has to a brain that was subjected to more <unk> than a woman who was born with their <unk> and a <unk> .
so , the sex is really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of the spectrum -- in a sense , you can be over the whole range of the whole range .
another example : a few years ago , i received the phone call a 19 and a boy who was born as a boy , he had a friend , had sex with his friend , who lived in her friend , who was he was <unk> and had a uterus .
he had a extreme form of an innate <unk> .
he has <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> were so strong , which they created a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> <unk> , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male part of the <unk> .
and as he was born , he saw like a boy -- nobody could see something .
and just when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was inside , the doctors found that he was inside a female .
okay , just a quick example of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , something called <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so , as , as many varieties of the things .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- is it <unk> or psychotic twins , it was <unk> -- that surgeons often be adjusted to the norm , is not because of their physical health of the purposes .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason that they &apos;re doing is often made different kinds of surgical surgeries , is because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a unique characteristic of an anatomical expression .
so we have the concept that a woman is to be a woman called a female identity ; a bad person is to be , to have an african anatomy in terms of your story .
so we have this extraordinarily outrageous idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body , which is actually something very different , confused us that in terms of these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> .
and our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is , when children are born , the two people in a body .
where i had experienced most of a lot of excitement , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , whose sex was asked in the question in berlin .
many journalists , i started calling me to the question of : &quot; what test will you do , which tells us whether <unk> <unk> is female or a male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s no test .
we now know that the sex is enough enough that we have to admit that nature is not a line between the <unk> and female and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ; we are the ones that are the separation of course .
so we have a situation that , where , the further our science progresses , we have to contend to be so more that these categories that made very simple <unk> to create permanent <unk> , much more <unk> than we &apos;ve adopted .
and that &apos;s not just about sex .
it &apos;s also true in the way of the time that it has been a lot more complicated than our <unk> has approved .
in our observation , we &apos;re going to be able to do all kinds of disciplines .
we &apos;re going to take into the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we start with the fact that we &apos;re just different from them through a few of these ?
while we continue to continue our science forward , we &apos;re increasingly getting increasingly into a zone of the <unk> where we recognize that the most <unk> categories that we were probably to be too simple .
we see this in all kinds of different parts of human life .
one of the areas that we see that in the <unk> , in our culture today , in the today today , in the today today , the fights of the beginning and the end of life .
we &apos;ve got a hard talk about what point is a body to people , so that it &apos;s a different right to life than life life .
we &apos;ve got very hard controversies -- maybe not as public as the public medicine -- about the question when someone &apos;s dead .
our ancestors used to be so hard to fight with the question when somebody was dead .
you just have someone to be a <unk> under the nose , and when they moved , they didn &apos;t bury them .
if you don &apos;t move it , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re going to take people to take people , take a way to take people , and they want to implant them .
and as a result , we caught us in the fight with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that makes us in a really difficult thing in which we don &apos;t have just <unk> the same categories where we used to have .
now they might assume that the <unk> of somebody like me really happy .
i &apos;m politically politically , i <unk> people with extraordinary bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are actually much more insecure than we thought , is that .
and it &apos;s me to think about that democracy is about the thinking of democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> of the <unk> , i need to take that , i first , i have a big fan of the founding .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i find that they were so <unk> and strong , and so radically , what they did , all of the years of what they did , and it &apos;s not because of music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because what &apos;s happened to the <unk> .
the founding fathers were in the way of the <unk> of <unk> activists , and that &apos;s why .
what she was a <unk> concept , and they replaced it through another , it &apos;s radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us were significant .
as you all remember , our founding <unk> of the monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the <unk> of the ancient world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of the .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power , they should have the political power , because the <unk> <unk> of the father &apos;s <unk> to father , and so on .
the founding fathers meadows that <unk> that idea and they replaced them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept that all the people were creating the same same .
they <unk> the field field , and decided that <unk> common common common , the common differences , and that was very radical .
now they did this part because they were part of a <unk> system in which two things in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , also grew up science .
and if you look at the story of the fathers , that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from the explanations of <unk> , and what sort of psychic psychic concept of power , back to where the transmission is based on a very elaborate concept of <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the case of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they did a concept of the most precious common .
and so , you have a really wonderful way the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened next year ?
for example , women , who used to the <unk> , the concept of the founding fathers that says that there is the most common difference than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; that we should have a <unk> and <unk> , etc . , etc .
and women <unk> that successfully .
and next came the successful civil rights civil rights rights , where we saw the <unk> <unk> that <unk> on top of the , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> series of <unk> saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people &apos;s people who are <unk> on the anatomical common common common , and again , successfully .
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
and of course , the problem is that , as well , we start to look at all the commonalities , we need to start to ask the question of why we &apos;re sustained certain <unk> .
well , you mind , i want to be a certain <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to give you a fish , not the same one of the same one of the right as a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should be from anatomy from anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be right to be willing to sex with permission or to marry their permission .
so there &apos;s some anatomic <unk> that make sense of the things that we do , and we should think , to keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them and how they &apos;re feeling .
so , we get back to these two creatures that are <unk> at the beginning of speech .
we have two creatures , both of the center of 1979 , the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of you , maria , three months of <unk> , she &apos;s born at the one june 1980 .
<unk> , on the other hand , is going to be born to the <unk> , he &apos;s at the last one , 1980 , he was born .
just because of the fact that maria was born three months , she takes all of the right three months before <unk> -- that &apos;s right to choose to do the right to drink .
<unk> has to wait for all this , not because it actually has a different set of time , except by the <unk> of his birth .
we find other more <unk> about what their rights are .
<unk> , because you assume that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t say that he &apos;s the <unk> -- you think he &apos;s a male , he &apos;s moved in , which is the maria doesn &apos;t worry about .
maria on the same , not in all states , the same thing , the henry &apos;s in all states , and that &apos;s right to marry this .
<unk> can marry a woman , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we have this permanently <unk> categories in many ways and ethically ethically .
and for me , the question is : what will we do that we &apos;re doing this in the domain of the anatomy , that we reach a point where we have to admit that a democracy is that built on anatomy , and it &apos;s <unk> ?
i want to give the science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like the science is its own .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we need to pull somewhere a line , so we pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught in a very strange position .
so , for example , i decided to a point , that a man is to marry a man means that you don &apos;t have a y chromosome , and a woman to marry you you have a grape chromosome .
now in practice , people are not going to test their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i &apos;ve told you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers a dream of &quot; a dream . &quot;
he says , we should not be to &quot; your skin color , but after the property of your character , &quot; -- and goes out of anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , it sounds like a good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you guys people in their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be so on to people who are so to be so , because i have to say that i have a series of <unk> <unk> , who probably probably more social than some people i know .
i want to suggest that i probably know that i &apos;m probably aware of the bright <unk> of the <unk> , more intelligent and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more <unk> decisions about their sexual relations as some of the ones that i know .
so how do we should ask the question for the character of the character ?
it &apos;s a really hard thing .
and one of me wonder about what if the content of a personality would something that would be something that would be done in the future of being done by an fmri ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems important to think about the idea that the united states is to be able to think about questions about the questions of democracy .
in our endeavor for democracy , we did it well , and i think we would make our things in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like , like , for instance , where a man is attracted to other men , who is punished to participate in the case of the <unk> in which he can stay alive .
in the way , that kind of exist .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these modes of these states -- a surgeon that had a a few years ago , who had a few <unk> twins , who had a few <unk> twins to separate them , part of themselves .
but when i was him with him , and he asked him why he did these subjects -- it was the <unk> operations -- his answer , that children would be very bad at its country , and so he had to do it .
and i said to him , &quot; well , they have moved to be a political asylum instead of being <unk> to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide tremendous possibilities to be people who they are , without needing to change the state .
and so i think , we need to be a leader .
well , just to finish , i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of how democracy could look like , or what if we could have had the mothers of the mothers .
and i want to say something that &apos;s a radical is something radical , and i think there may be different kinds of insight , which is the different kinds of choice , the different kinds of anatomy , <unk> when people use a <unk> .
for years , because i was interested in <unk> , i also have been interested in the realm of <unk> .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , on average -- not every , but on average -- more complex , complex social relations and the care of people who are vulnerable to people who are vulnerable to people who are vulnerable to be very much .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation before we think .
and i was a graduate student , i asked a graduate student , who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked as a feminist , so i &apos;m going to -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what was a female .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about <unk> about gender , which is why not a female feminism .
but the more i thought about his question , so more i thought there could be something <unk> in feminism .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be , there could be something , on average , which is a average of a male brains of what makes us <unk> social relationships for social relations , and <unk> for the <unk> .
where the founding fathers were extremely considered to find out how individuals could be protected , it can be that when we put more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more a concept of <unk> , not only how to protect , but how we can &apos;t worry about each other .
and maybe it is where we need to go to the future , if we have to democracy democracy -- less about the individual body of identity , and more about relationships .
that , if we &apos;re used to make a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve been doing , i &apos;m a very public confession , and that &apos;s , i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to find a chance to find a different <unk> of crazy outfit , and to take a time to photograph and blog to take a lot of blog .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from a second hand in <unk> and <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> to the environment , and also my purse .
i meet all kinds of great people ; i have to serve dollars for usual , a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s going to buy the <unk> of my very personal <unk> .
i mean , what will i find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
am i going to like color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , &quot; i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve been packing for this very week at ted .
i mean , what do someone do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you very much , what i brought .
i brought seven of the underwear in the , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> out of the one week , everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve bet that i was going to wear anything , which i might have to wear , if i &apos;d just go to palm springs .
and since you don &apos;t have heard of me than the woman who are walking through in your underwear , which is that i found a few things .
and i &apos;m going to show you my <unk> for this week .
sounds good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to leave you some of the lessons that i believe in whether or not you &apos;ve learned from these <unk> , nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call the radiant tigers .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost be a great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole kind of outfit , including the coat has to be 55 , and it was the most expensive piece i carried in this entire week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological to be bad when you put pants down pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;ll pull the other people on .
tuesday : so , is absolutely <unk> .
i spent a lot of time of my life to try and try to be myself , and to adapt at the same time .
be just who they &apos;re .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , they will not only understand it , you will be valuing it .
wednesday : embracing your inner child .
sometimes people say , i know , i &apos;m dressed , &quot; i &apos;m wearing the games or i remember your seven-year-olds .
i &apos;d like smile , and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think , you &apos;re looking at something , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think they &apos;re not good in something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me a day in day .
but only when i got 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll wrap it for a minute .
if you believe that they &apos;re inside and the outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing that they can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse me to someone in this audience .
we should be able to do everything we want to do .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit .
and finally , saturday , one , a unique , unique learning is a great way to tell something about one about a word without having to say a word without having to say a word without having to say a word without having to say a word without having to say a word without having to say a word without having to say a word without having to
it was always been in me and over that week , when in this week , people just did , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great talk .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to the brooklyn , i will give it all over to .
because the lesson that i &apos;ve been trying to learn to do this week , that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to emotional <unk> , because the same thing is , it &apos;s always a different crazy , <unk> <unk> <unk> that just waiting for me when i love a little love in your heart and search for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something that i &apos;d like to show you .
think of this as a <unk> , flying <unk> .
that is what we call in our lab , design design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this image -- i &apos;m in the italian , and every boy in italy , in the middle of this image in the room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you about this in the formula one in the last decades .
a while ago , it was so that if she wanted to win a formula 1 , then they took her budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the truckers were good enough , they won it .
now , you know , if you want to win a race , actually actually something like this -- something like this -- something that has a lot of a thousand sensors that has information to make it back and make things in real time as information as information .
this would you , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made from two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is that is the <unk> start in our lives .
our cities were been in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to computer in the free .
and as a computer in the free , they start to think in other ways , they &apos;re being being .
if we zoom in <unk> , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
but by the way , i want to mention that cities only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the global population is there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- causing to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so , if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
and beyond the cities , pulling all of this view and will be a lot of the objects of everyday life .
this is from a exhibition , the paola treat is going to be in the year , the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; with me . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , begin to talk to us .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as if any atom is going out there , a sensor and a <unk> .
and that &apos;s changing the interaction that we have to have people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as michelangelo shaped the moses shaped , he &apos;s the hammer and he threw him on moses -- actually , you can still see a little spot of <unk> -- and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you ? &quot;
now , today , our environment is the very first time to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of what we can perceive and power .
let &apos;s start with the sense .
now the first project i want to introduce to you is in the truth one of our labs .
it was formed in italy , a half years ago in italy .
and what we did was actually , actually a time of the network that was put on the world -- that &apos;s a <unk> -- and blind and <unk> information from this network that are being collected from the operators of the operators of the the operators .
the summer , a happy summer -- 2006 , 2006 .
it was the <unk> of italy .
some of you will remember , it was playing in italy , and then at the end of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and no matter , italy has won the end .
now , you see what happened on this day , just watching activity , the activity that happens in the network .
here &apos;s the city .
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
on the morning , in front of the game .
you see the timeline .
the answer , people here , and there , the calls calls and moving .
the game starts to -- silence .
france makes a gateway . italy , one door .
<unk> , people make a <unk> call , go to the toilets .
second <unk> . end of normal play .
first , , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in this night , all the time went to the center of celebration .
they saw the great important .
the next day , all the time went to the center to meet the <unk> and the minister of the minister .
and then all went down .
you see the picture of the location , where the rome station , the the rome station , the people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the implications at the end of the day .
well , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way we couldn &apos;t have it in a few years ago .
but i &apos;m very quickly , another example of things : this is not to people , but to do things that we use and consume .
well , now , we know all of how our things are coming from .
this is a map that shows you all of the chips that a mac computer , how they came together .
but we know just little about where the things go .
so we actually designed to actually designed a few little markers to try to track the garbage while he &apos;s about the system .
so we started with a few volunteers who helped us a year in seattle , the things that they were doing -- various kinds of things that you can see -- things that would you just fall out anyway .
and then we have the small chips , the little tags , on the trash and started tracking it .
here are the results that we &apos;re going to get .
from seattle ...
after a week .
and with this information , we realized there are a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things in doing less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s happening a lot of <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that cup of that , that &apos;s not just away somewhere on the planet somewhere .
and the plastic bottle that keeps always throw out there every day .
and if we were going to show that the people , then we can push change change change change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could you have a lot more about that , and the many of the wonderful things that you can do with , and you can tell you to talk to the second part , which we &apos;re talking about the beginning , and this is the most of the world &apos;s most vulnerable of our environment .
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve made in <unk> in spain , in spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> who came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition of public places in the way of architecture .
and the question was , how could you connect technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were in with a <unk> <unk> , , you know , you know that tubes , and valves , <unk> , valves , the valves up and close .
it &apos;s causing what a <unk> <unk> with water with water .
if those <unk> fall fall , you can write them , you can see patterns , images , signs of text .
and they can approach it , and he &apos;s going to open up to make you <unk> , as you can see on this image .
well , we introduced the mayor of <unk> .
it really did it very .
and we got to design a building at the entrance to design the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was made of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re approaching it , it &apos;s open up and put it in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy when they &apos;re going to add syringes , even can actually leave the roof .
or you could end up the building and and the whole thing is , like in this case , you know , that days , when you get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; they &apos;ve entrenched the building . &quot;
no , they don &apos;t <unk> the building , it &apos;s just like architecture almost disappears .
and here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who says what happens inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water , not get to get wet .
well , i should tell you what one night was going to all the sensors that all the sensors would work .
but actually , it was a more difficult for that night .
all of the children coming out of <unk> came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building , it &apos;s going to open to it , but a building that had kept and breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump without getting down without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how the people are doing things that we design .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with the people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projection .
and this is what we brought to think about this , to think about this , i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine that <unk> could actually start to fly .
imagine , they could have a little helicopter that flies through the air , and each of you with a little <unk> with light , and you can almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like that you saw earlier , who &apos;s completely in synchrony in synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> display or display like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or infrequently , but in three dimensions , where that changes , the light is not the position of the <unk> .
they can play with different kinds .
imagine that the screen could just appear in different sizes of <unk> or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then it could just be a 3d cloud of <unk> , which you can walk to walk and through the way you can see through the way that can look at many , many different directions .
here &apos;s a real <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to shape like before a <unk> v .
if you turn the lights on it , it looks like that , so as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people being being .
it could have a impulse that every single one that comes from people , from the movements of the people or whatnot .
i want to show you something about first .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> in milan -- we &apos;ve moved his movements in 3d <unk> to use it as a pulse for the <unk> .
and here you see <unk> dancing dancing .
on the left side , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so that you can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have <unk> , you can play with it and play with paint and <unk> play .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a potential impulse to the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is again , imagine that we &apos;re putting people to do something and to do something and to change the environment -- almost as we call it to make a <unk> <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that every one of a donation can give a little donation for a <unk> .
i think that the remarkable thing that happened is remarkable last years , the last decades that we &apos;re changed from a borderless of the digital world .
that &apos;s all digitized , knowledge , and it &apos;s accessible to the internet .
today , we can first time -- and the campaign administration has shown this -- we can change from the digital world from the <unk> forces of the physical world .
that can be in our case , that we &apos;re using it to design and to create a symbol .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built something in the city .
but tomorrow , to make us to the next to the next -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change the digital world to the physical .
so the idea is that we actually put people in the people in which they &apos;re doing with .
the cloud is back a cloud of <unk> in the same way a cloud of particles is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s a physical shape in london , but with <unk> .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments of <unk> 2012 and and more and more and as a way of connecting to community .
so the the physical cloud of the sky and something about the top you can go to the way of the city of london .
you can get inside .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for all the things that wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i think , is very important .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are separated from nature , and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in front of almost 10 years ago in antarctica where i saw my first <unk> .
i <unk> awe .
my heart chute , i was <unk> , while i was trying to take what was standing in front of me .
the <unk> around me , almost 60 feet of water , and i could just wonder that the one was a snowflake in another snowflake year .
and <unk> are born as a calf or by <unk> from <unk> .
each iceberg has its individual personality .
they interact with their environment and their experience .
some people are giving up and prevent them until bitter bitter , whereas others don &apos;t withstand it , and they would have a <unk> more passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you &apos;re isolated , separate , and just as we can see us a lot of us .
but the truth is far from it .
while a iceberg melt , i put it up its <unk> atmosphere .
as the iceberg melt , it puts the water water , which is a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to take my pictures of this <unk> portraits , i was able to make portraits of my ancestors in the mind that they exist in these individual moments , and never again .
it &apos;s not a death , if you melt it ; it &apos;s not a end , but a <unk> of your <unk> along the cycle cycle .
part of the ice in the <unk> , which i was a very young -- a couple of years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last few pictures i &apos;d like to show you is showing a rope that i &apos;ve got <unk> in the greenland in greenland .
very , actually , actually actually actually actually actually witnessing a <unk> block .
here &apos;s what you see .
on the left side , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
and you &apos;ll pay attention to the shape of the vector and where it &apos;s on the <unk> .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
that &apos;s the average size of a <unk> .
it reaches about 120 feet of water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this , you &apos;ll show you a different side of your personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinarily really , through the work of some amazing projects .
but in the coolest thing that i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> <unk> in the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came back and he said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the than .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was talking to him .
i have a company designing design and animations , graffiti is a complex part of what we admire in the art museum and pay attention .
so we decided to , tony -- <unk> -- and his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we will give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony .
and i just want to him with him and i asked , &quot; well , is that not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard to the higher <unk> of the and a remarkable insurance , you can actually do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you do ? &quot;
did anybody see the film &apos; butterfly and <unk> ? &quot;
so they communicate -- so they &apos;re going to walk along .
i <unk> : &quot; very <unk> , how can it be ? &quot;
so i got to a need to just a check , and instead i asked a check from that i didn &apos;t the smallest idea of how i was going to <unk> him .
i committed to place and he &apos;s a place to his brother and his father -- in the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this : tony will be , we &apos;ll get a way to find it back to his art .
because it &apos;s a farce that somebody who &apos;s going to be all in itself , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i was talking about a couple months later at a conference .
i met these guys from <unk> , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on any surface and then put with a <unk> of that , which is only the negative space .
so they draw around and make more <unk> like this .
they say that all things that are going to be displayed up , a life cycle .
it starts with the testes , then the <unk> , the <unk> , then the <unk> , and the final thing to do art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentation .
so i went home and ate with my wife and i was told her most of all , and we thought , &quot; well , second , if there is this technology that you can use your eyes with things that would be a <unk> , that it &apos;s genius . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year after a year after a year , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we have the insurance companies to <unk> the doors , and actually actually get a device to communicate with it -- a device that he can communicate -- a <unk> .
that was incredible .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call it <unk> , because you talk about him , or get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and then we have seven programmers from the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house .
and many of our friends thought we were beautiful stupid that we do that , and we all the pictures of the photos were <unk> <unk> .
but for about two weeks , we &apos;ve been programming , we went to the <unk> in venice , my children were involved in , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought on the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things from the hardware store and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they have a <unk> , they put them on a <unk> pad , and now we have a device that we &apos;re free to do it yourself -- you can build it yourself , we make the code free , the software is free for free .
so we created a device that is completely free of constraints .
no insurance can be <unk> .
neither a hospital .
and every <unk> can actually communicate with his eyes or drawing .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back in the <unk> room .
i love this image because it &apos;s the room from somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all of these <unk> <unk> in front of the great unveiling .
and after a year , two weeks , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony &apos;s got to seven years after seven years .
and this is a remarkable picture , because this is his life support system , and he sees it beyond life life system .
we &apos;ve tilted down to the way he can see outside .
we put an <unk> on a wall of the hospital hospital in front of the hospital .
and he did , again , the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling was on the parking lot .
and <unk> , we had to <unk> into the parking lot of <unk> , so we were so much as a part of the <unk> .
and the end , he would send us to a lesson with this : &quot; for the first time for seven years i &apos;ve been drawing something .
i feel that i was pushed underwater , and finally someone down to the bottom and my head up with it , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
that &apos;s something like our <unk> .
that keeps us in the shelf and let &apos;s get a further .
and we have to do better than that machine .
it &apos;s an amazing thing , but it comes a <unk> right now .
and someone who has such a potential potential , it makes a lot more .
so we &apos;re in the way to figure out how to make it better and stronger .
for that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it .
it comes from our own pockets .
so the <unk> were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , has been honored to be a of the <unk> of 2010 , which was really great .
the <unk> of it is -- and it fills this whole circle -- that it &apos;s about this april , the <unk> <unk> in downtown los angeles , in the city of los angeles , called &quot; the kind of the <unk> . &quot;
and there are probably the hardest officials to be the <unk> of the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is pretty stupid .
so basically , i &apos;m thinking about : if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then , you can do it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , that microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- they all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer and i had never been doing anything with a <unk> , but i just drew something and so with amazing people with that , so we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be every single day , and that &apos;s where you have some single day that you have to do something that has to be done , if not now when ? and if not me , who ?
thank you .
so i write for children , and i &apos;m probably the most <unk> <unk> .
and i &apos;m telling people that i &apos;m not like a scientist , and i want to come .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has chosen to be elected .
today , i &apos;d like to tell you about circles and <unk> .
well , a enlightenment is usually something that you find it somewhere in the time you &apos;ve left it somewhere .
you go to the block , and it &apos;s a revelation .
that &apos;s a painting of a circle .
one of my friends have done it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle of that i want to tell you today .
my circle started at the &apos; 60s at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who saved a week in the <unk> and blue , until a teacher would saved my life until a teacher .
she saved my life by putting me the toilet in the <unk> .
they did secretly .
she did it three years .
and i had to go from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it came to san francisco in california -- and i found a lover -- and then in the 1980s , i found it important to take a work on <unk> .
so about three or four years ago , i got a call from the night , a woman , <unk> , who said , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned to each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the guy that i know that they &apos;ve found it .
and i should say that i have <unk> , and i want you to go ahead . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we were laughing , we were laughing , and we knew that they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we were caring for them , and we gave them to their family , because it needed to be , for it .
it was something we knew about .
and just as the woman who was learning as adults turned to to come out of his box , she turned into a box of his hands .
what happens was that the circle closed was closed , it has become a circle -- and the revelation of the revelation of the i was .
the revelation is , that &apos;s a part of life .
she has saved my life , and my partner and i rescued her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest needs .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is mentioned as many times .
it takes the same thing -- it takes , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about to give these things .
thank you .
so , imagine a large blast , while she climb up to 1,000 feet .
imagine a airplane in the smoke .
imagine a engine engine , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that sounds fear .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk about the <unk> .
and i looked at it , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already been <unk> , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later happened three things later .
the pilot is designed to the hudson river .
that &apos;s not not the route .
it turns out the engines .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the words that i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> to the ground . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk about the <unk> .
i could see it in her eyes , because it was <unk> , life was to the end .
i &apos;d like to share three things that i &apos;ve learned about that day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have these <unk> , we have these things that we want to live in life , and i thought to all the people who wanted to do a hand , and it didn &apos;t actually , all the fences that i wanted to do and never did .
while i was thinking about it , i found a saying , which is , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
because if you &apos;re as well , and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to change some more change in life .
and that urgency , this goal , has changed my life .
the second thing that i learned about that day -- and that was , when we <unk> george washington &apos;s bridge , so rather to <unk> , because i thought , human , there &apos;s one thing i really do .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to be better , in everything i &apos;m going to do better .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given my ego .
and i &apos;m a time i &apos;m doing a lot of <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and then , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
i hadn &apos;t <unk> two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to do right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- and that while internal clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to get in 20 parts , like you know from a documentary .
while we <unk> , i had this feeling , human , to die , not a .
almost like we would prepare for our lives for all of it .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that &apos;s a true of sadness , really in a thought , that i just want to do one thing .
i just wish i could have my children grow up .
and about a month after that , i went to a performance of my daughter -- <unk> , not much more of <unk> ...
still not .
and i &apos;m , in a <unk> , i cry like a little kid .
and in the world , everything for me .
and i realized that , by doing the dots that it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my single purpose of life , a good father .
i was the miracle of the miracle of that day , that day .
i got another gift to see in the future and to come back and live in life .
my call to all the way that flies today is : imagine , you know , the same thing that happens on your flight -- please not -- but imagine it before ; and how would you change ?
what would you do that much that you &apos;re going to do that , because you think they were forever there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are they &apos;re the best parents that can be only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is quite simple .
we don &apos;t want to be iran to build the bomb .
the most important is there for the development of nuclear weapons , is the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes that you see here , these are <unk> .
and if we manage to <unk> the systems that <unk> and valves , we can actually create a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes are not running with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , an effective <unk> system on a laptop that is used by a <unk> , to <unk> this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind the <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> goes into the gray box , the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> <unk> himself .
it &apos;s a darn darn machine , right ?
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve found that .
and when we started to <unk> our research on six months ago , was completely unknown , which was the meaning and purpose of this was the .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated to the most complex , the <unk> part , he made by <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
and it seemed to a little bit of <unk> , with these gray boxes , these <unk> boxes .
and the <unk> of our attention and we started a <unk> project where we were in with <unk> , and we studied this what &apos;s what .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> as a <unk> that <unk> our cheese didn &apos;t like to eat our cheese -- but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that &apos;s not a sense in my eyes .
and after we had done with various kinds of cheese , i went to that this was a <unk> attack .
completely set up at a particular target .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> active in the <unk> box , if a special configuration was discovered , even if that particular program that &apos;s going to be used to this goal .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t matter .
so , this was really really my interest , and we started working on it , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a <unk> american power station , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> , we found the <unk> code and found that it &apos;s in two digital warheads -- smaller and a bigger one .
and also , it also occurred to that they were very constructed by people who had obviously <unk> information .
they knew all bits and <unk> that had to attack them .
probably probably knew it even the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already heard that the <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
this is a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 notes .
it looks like an ancient <unk> of <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be able to be able to be out of this code .
so after what we were looking for first , was <unk> <unk> , because we know what this does .
and then we went to <unk> and <unk> and tried to try to bring this with the real world -- to potential destinations in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could have been shown or something .
to make these theories , we call it to be about <unk> <unk> , it has to act a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s probably been reported in iran because they were buried in iran because there &apos;s been the most infections that were reported .
now in this field , there &apos;s not a couple of have a thousand goals .
basically , it &apos;s just out on the <unk> nuclear power plant and on the <unk> <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; let me give me a list of all experts for <unk> and power out of our <unk> . &quot;
and i called her and <unk> her to define what we found in the code and the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
so the rotor is that moving in within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you tamper that , if you tamper that , you actually actually get the to the rotor and even even to explode the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the disease actually was to slow and incredibly to try and get to try and try to try and get to <unk> , so that they can &apos;t be able to get to be able to get back to the quickly behind it .
the big digital <unk> -- we got a insight by which we looked at a very precisely data and <unk> .
so , for example , the number of <unk> is a very code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to see scientific literature , and the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , and found that they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and every <unk> has <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it was getting better .
these <unk> in iran are divided in 15 types of so-called planes .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s a almost identical structure .
so again , that fit together .
and this was great confidence for that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t you get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go .
and these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
and often , we were just running in a <unk> , and we had to take us .
anyway , we found that both of the digital warheads actually are in fact , and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes a 3d , and <unk> moves down and it starts and the big <unk> starts with six <unk> in interaction and manipulated valves .
so , in large , and all we are very confident that we actually have to have what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be made by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- it &apos;s made me out of the socks .
there &apos;s gray box down there , and you see the <unk> .
now , what this thing is that it &apos;s the forces values of sensors -- so for example of <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s <unk> code for the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
and actually , this false forces are recorded from <unk> .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> is fed with the <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
now the idea of this is obviously not just , the <unk> in the control system .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more than more than .
the idea is to <unk> digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a plant plant , for example , if the large <unk> is going to be , you have to open up in milliseconds of milliseconds .
of course , this is not being done by a human being done .
so , in this point , we need digital <unk> .
and if the risk are , really bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and neither the <unk> , even the <unk> will notice it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it &apos;s going to be worse .
and that &apos;s very important to say , is very important .
think about it . this is a <unk> .
he doesn &apos;t have anything to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so he would be working in for example , in a power station or in a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- the predator -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> stick , as we saw it in <unk> .
you could also use a trivial <unk> technology to the top .
you have to spread it as much as possible .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the implication that we need to ask ourselves .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they are in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most vulnerable environments .
we need to ask the consequences , and we &apos;ll get better ready to prepare it .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was very much of that reported that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> behind it .
is that that &apos;s what ?
okay , you want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
and i think , in my opinion , is involved in the <unk> , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the most <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- luckily , fortunately .
because otherwise , our problem is even larger .
thank you that you &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> . thank you .
i spent the last few years of this , in situations that usually , which is very difficult and in some kind of dangerous .
i went to prison -- hard .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> , it &apos;s difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days , nothing than this to eat this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
i actually , i &apos;ve been exposed to the most part of my career in a very <unk> situation , and that all that is that all the way to explore for the try and design so that they &apos;re compelling and interesting , and hopefully in a way of understanding what makes them to the audience enjoyable and accessible .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here to be able to come here in a ted conference in the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would do something a little bit different .
some of you may have heard that a couple of weeks ago , a a <unk> display on ebay .
i would just put a couple of <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> the <unk> of the tedtalk in 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , who got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never ever be a very title -- the <unk> of the evidence of the story was actually .
so what you got was , her name is : my ted , you know , you know what the subject is going to be , and the rest of the world , you could fly to the ears , especially if i give their company for their own business .
but it &apos;s all over time , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
that &apos;s just the <unk> .
so , despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the lottery buy .
now , if you had asked me this to a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have to be able to say to you to do this with certainty .
but in the new project i &apos;m working on , my new film , we &apos;re looking at the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone in a couple of awful terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could prepare me to anything that hard and dangerous like this guy in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , which is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot;
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> , is that everything from the top up to the end , with a lot of brands -- from the <unk> you &apos;re going to see in the movie , which is the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these people will be connected to the film in the past .
and so this is the movie that &apos;s going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more on the accent .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x than a <unk> , but we &apos;re sure we &apos;re going to be selling any possible for any possible thing in the movie .
so we may not sell a shoe , and he will be the greatest shoe that you ever carried ...
the greatest car that they ever had the dangers , &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink that they &apos;ve ever had to have a attention from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides , besides , is that tags are a part of life , actually , to get them to finance the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy to help if <unk> would help make this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how to be <unk> people .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; look &quot; it &apos;s a negative <unk> -- but you know how this is going to develop ?
how much money is going to do to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet it , but i think it &apos;s worth the value of a couple of really familiar tokens .
who knows , if the film comes out , we might see like a <unk> of <unk> .
what do you think about how the answer will be ?
the answer is probably be probably , &quot; be the &quot;
but it &apos;s a difficult thing about it because of the movie or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so ... meaning , not so optimistic .
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what tokens .
yeah .
if you look at the people with you to do it .
there are some places that we can turn to us .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; well , &quot; the camera , &quot; would we wanted to leave a <unk> .
it turned out that it meant , &quot; we want to do with your film . &quot;
and just as all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no one wanted to do something with the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t have to do anything with the project .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept of advertising is to make your product as many people as possible as possible to present it as many people as possible .
and in particular , in the world today , in this intersection of new and old media , and the most advanced media -- is it not the idea of being in this new exciting <unk> to be that the masses are required .
no , that was what i thought .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was the following .
actually , no , it wasn &apos;t the mistakes at all .
that &apos;s not a problem at all .
that would be fine .
but that &apos;s what this image is , is a problem .
see , if you &apos;re transparency in the <unk> , that &apos;s one of the first pictures that seems to be .
i really like your kind of sergey brin .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> , and <unk> from <unk> and access to information , particularly , in particular , <unk> , the last line is probably the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re now , we &apos;re going to hear a whole bunch of transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it , even our ceos .
but if it is going to be implemented , it &apos;s going to be done .
but why ? well , transparency is <unk> <unk> -- like this strange bear , the still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else else is risk ?
a whole bowl of cool food food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want to tell a story .
we want to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father caught me on lying -- and he sits and looking at me at this point -- he would say , &quot; son , there &apos;s three versions of the story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s only a company , an agency was ready to help us -- and that &apos;s because i &apos;m just because i &apos;ve had to do it , i had to deal with the <unk> , and right with my team .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand was that , when you start to talk to these companies who is understood how your brand is a <unk> problem .
i have friends who do big , gigantic <unk> , and i have friends , the little more <unk> like me .
and my friends , who are the big , humongous <unk> , say that the reason why their films are so successful about the <unk> of the <unk> they have .
and then my friends say , the little <unk> , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , gigantic competing competing ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , how are we going to see ban in the film ?
whenever i go on the way , and i &apos;m going to open the door , you will see the <unk> .
and every time i <unk> someone , i can say , &quot; are you enough to get it out of this ?
are they &apos;re far , you &apos;re a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
maybe you should be able to put it a little bit before the interview . &quot;
and then we &apos;re offering one of those great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have the vote .
we will be <unk> for men and for women , and they are <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the <unk> .
now i can answer all your questions and give you a <unk> version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the little movies of these little films , we &apos;re a <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like another brand .
so , so things -- you know , remember , to ban , that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
what words would you describe to ban ?
ban , is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way to describe something that someone &apos;s doing under the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a great word that this should really make a positive positive , as opposed to &quot; fighting judgment and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we hold it more than it -- better fresh , more fresh , three , <unk> .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , which are like me , <unk> .
i want to tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really love to nice clothing .
<unk> &apos; 80s <unk> meets <unk> , except at the <unk> .
now , what is the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style that i have , is probably the glamour glamour . &quot;
i like black colors , lots of black colors , and so on this stuff .
but i usually have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry , and so forth .
if dan would be a brand , it would probably be a classic mercedes <unk> .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , i would say , <unk> fly .
i &apos;m part of the , part of the , i call it , partly <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell to <unk> all over the country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
that &apos;s my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man four : my brand is fedex , because i was <unk> .
<unk> 5 : brand <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
a lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i &apos;m often seeing the intersection of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what is noticed that i needed an expert .
i needed someone who could be in my head , somebody who really could really help me understand what you call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so i found a company called olson <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , helped to discover this <unk> .
if they could do it for the , they could help me .
they brought their pictures with me , right ?
i &apos;ve got . the first image is a picture of my family .
and tell me a little bit about how that with your thoughts and feelings about it .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world that you live in -- how people around you , the friends , the way you live in , the way you live lives , the work and so .
all of these things come from and start from a place , and to me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing about that you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that about the thought and feelings about it ?
it &apos;s like i want to be like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like curious things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what do you do ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? in which is they currently right ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about them , they &apos;re not .
what else they got to do ?
... it doesn &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you !
thank you very much for their patience .
yeah . well . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it is going to be .
there was a lot of crazy things .
the first thing i saw was that they had two separate , but they have a half-inch pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> .
the are very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction that .
and i think some companies will just focus on a strength , instead of both on .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re not afraid to avoid fear , those elements , and they turn them into yourself in something that , and it &apos;s actually a <unk> <unk> .
what other brands are doing ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , <unk> , the wii , mini von mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there &apos;s <unk> tokens and <unk> tags , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , brand brand . how is your brand ?
if someone asked you to describe your <unk> , their <unk> , how would you ?
they &apos;re a <unk> ? are you something that brings your blood in ?
or are they more likely to be a <unk> ?
are you something that is a little bit quiet , <unk> , conservative ?
<unk> are things that are the playful , fresh like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> and agile , profane , magic and <unk> and <unk> like <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , like the <unk> ?
are it reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , <unk> , <unk> , fashion like the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of the movie , we were more than 500 companies , and they were up and <unk> , and they were saying , &quot; no , &quot; because they &apos;re not part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do with this film because they don &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 <unk> who were willing to dispense with these control , and so miserable and playful like me , and the to the <unk> of the time , and the <unk> of us to tell stories that we don &apos;t usually have to have heard about -- stories that never would ordinarily support .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re using <unk> to the <unk> of the brain , and to make advertising for advertising as well .
we were riding sao paulo , where <unk> was being forbidden .
in the entire city , for five years , not a poster , not a poster , no poster , nothing .
and we drove in school school where companies were moving in the way to the <unk> schools in the world .
and the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got to get the most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are , where i interacted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these tags have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and said that the agencies may not really have their interest in the sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him and something completely different , something that people will think about it , that our minds will change our minds .
how did it for you ? what it does ?
now , since the movie was the movie film , &quot; the movie was the first time we can look at this .
according to the <unk> of january , and since -- and that &apos;s not all the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of the movie film .
that &apos;s actually a period of two 1 / two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s no <unk> there . no <unk> .
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , which almost every <unk> of us , who we talked to , their customers , who was going to be finger .
something that i believe is that if you put down down to the chance , that you get to put down its chance , that in these risks to put in the risks .
i think if you fall , people from it , you get them to fail .
i think that if you were trained to avoid the employees , you &apos;re prepared to get a profit for a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take a lot of risks .
we need to encourage people to have not afraid to have any ways that they might maybe <unk> .
finally , the progress we should be scared to be .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome to be scared . welcome to the risk .
they &apos;re a big taste of a big taste , so that &apos;s what we &apos;re welcome to risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it takes us a little bit of a little bit of course .
and that , with honesty and transparency , my whole talk &quot; &quot; i &apos;m welcome to be <unk> by my good friends , who <unk> $ <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
big data is going to be turned for organizations around the world in big opportunities .
<unk> : &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot;
thank you .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency , what is exactly what &apos;s going on with $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i put a check in my pocket , put on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check -- a check in the <unk> of <unk> to fund my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
so 18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i &apos;m doing something to do with the museums and art , and my favorite <unk> , who &apos;s also , and i was , green , and i was green .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations , and stories that can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the slide .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and her access to it .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education , i didn &apos;t -- but i had to many museums and the of art works , and this artwork .
and when i went to visit , and i went to visit , i started learning a lot .
and while i worked for google , i tried to make this yearning to do this , art accessible to do with technology .
we then then we took a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;ll tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you &apos;re just to <unk> .
you can see all of these museums .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i actually come into one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get two of it in the same time -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , is in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they &apos;re -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and <unk> .
you want to be in the museum ?
open the map , and you can jump it with a click .
they are they want to be like to gangs to the end of the gangs .
just further . much fun .
take it through .
thank you , but the best is coming .
now , i &apos;m in front of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum has given us to do this , and click on it .
so this is one of the images .
this is the metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , can click here -- but i &apos;m going to go away this .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve tagged with what called the <unk> .
for example , this image has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can very easily and <unk> .
you can see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want to be deep inside .
and so i started playing around , and realized that there is something about it .
and i thought , &quot; well , &quot; wait , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went to the , and i realized , and i was slowly , that these kids actually put something .
i worked a little bit , with some familiar with the met , and actually found it to a game called <unk> , where a goose was beaten on a shelf with a stick .
it seemed to be very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to get to really close to go to the cracks .
just to give you the lesson , i &apos;m going to see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best one is still -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump up to the moma , again , again in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
so , in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what if you want to see , by van <unk> that masterpiece to be this masterpiece ?
you put in in . you can go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my favorite photograph of this image until i really am to the cracks .
that &apos;s <unk> , probably never seen this before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite feature .
there &apos;s still many more , but i don &apos;t have the time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , which is called the collections .
each of them , everyone -- right is rich or poor , if you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can create it and online , and online , and they can create their own collection of a collection .
just they go , and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the <unk> -- you can browse .
that &apos;s the <unk> , in the <unk> .
they can put it all with them , and they &apos;re talking , and so entertainment start to what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , for me , is the main thing that all the wonderful things are not coming from google .
they &apos;re not coming to the museums .
that &apos;s not supposed to say that .
they come from artists .
and that was a humbling experience in <unk> .
i mean , i hope that we will be just with this digital medium in the art and they &apos;re properly online .
and this is the biggest question that i was asked to be asked , &quot; did you make it to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a schematic of your brain . your brain can be divided into two camps .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , the the the side is .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of any hemisphere , we could pose your brain .
for example , that somebody is completely irrelevant .
this is somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you put your brain on that ?
some of us may have been the extreme , but i think that , for most people in the audience , their brain is something like this -- with a high <unk> , which is at the same time .
it &apos;s not like either , as if they &apos;re both from these or whatnot .
they can sense and intuitively , and that &apos;s intuitive .
and so i see as one of the people in common with the most other experimental experimental practices that need a good component to add a good amount of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good deal with a lot of intuition to do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play it with things .
so we go out and play and play and and look like it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably a thing to be just at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange about that a thing at the same time at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
i remember a kid in playing on a <unk> of a <unk> .
he was a toddler , and he was a whole , and he was constantly looking at all .
but i bet it &apos;s a very valuable lesson with the <unk> , which is that big things that you can &apos;t just get over , and that they remain in a place .
and that &apos;s a great <unk> model of the world , so long as they &apos;re not a <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with a <unk> , but with these little peculiar particles .
and if you play with their particles , you can find all kinds of weird things -- how they &apos;re going to be directly through walls , or that they can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the most of the physics of a few years ago , and you took a quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you don &apos;t need to describe the big everyday objects around us .
that &apos;s not like my intuition , and that maybe i don &apos;t like to play with the same way with particles .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , no one has seen a particle .
but my logical hand doesn &apos;t have liked it .
because if all of things are particles , and all these particles are the rules of quantum mechanics , then not just the rules of the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it should not be so .
so i would have to be clear to feel about the whole thing , if we could somehow show that the rules of the quantum mechanics are .
so i made myself a few years ago , right now .
i created one .
this is the first object that you can see , which was in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green spot there in the middle .
that &apos;s the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
that &apos;s a picture of the object .
this is something that i &apos;ll do something . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really very big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal , it &apos;s like a springboard and it &apos;s over the edge over .
so i did this thing in a way that you make a computer chip .
i went a a clean room with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all the big .
for the last few , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> pool of hole and get the thing .
this thing has the capacity to be in the <unk> , but it takes a a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a complete elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator alone , i &apos;m going to do all kinds of weird things but then , and i &apos;m listening to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to bother it , or , frankly , &quot; they &apos;re <unk> .
so quantum mechanics says , there are <unk> objects themselves as well .
the <unk> of <unk> objects are not only people , but also the light that seems to them and the wind that seems by you and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal <unk> , we had to <unk> the entire <unk> out .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we put the light off , put it in a vacuum , and it &apos;s a <unk> air and it &apos;s almost like to now , it &apos;s on the the elevator , and it was the piece of metal free , to behave like it .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it really strange .
instead of that it &apos;s just because it &apos;s just because it &apos;s a way it was like this -- like this -- like this one <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and we could take a little push in a little push , we could make it to vibrate at the same time and not to vibrate -- something that &apos;s just in the mechanics of quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what &apos;s really fantastic .
what is it to vibrate for a object to vibrate and not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms are out of the piece of atoms , and at the same time , the same atoms move on and down .
just too precise , they agree with them .
the rest of the time they are <unk> .
that means that every atom at the same time is at two different places , which is the same thing that &apos;s the entire piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s cool right .
really .
that was worth of it for all this year in the clean room , because , you check this , the <unk> of an atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom at the same time at two different places , this piece can be in two different places , and then not you can &apos;t do it ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical answer is saying .
so , imagine , they &apos;d be at a very same time in a couple places , what would that feel like ?
how would you have conscious minds to do that your body is going to be in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> , and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal in a piece of metal was in a piece of it .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator is just <unk> objects that are in a small room together .
you hear a lot of rhetoric about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more beyond it , it &apos;s still deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their ties with all the things around them , literally define who they are . and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be more skeptical about how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they live and work , you want to choose the opportunity to choose between one hand of of various cities all the competition that all in competition to the new people .
we &apos;re far from the destination far from this .
there are billions of people in developing countries which not even have a city to be available to be called the way .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth than it costs to build it .
so we could just the world with <unk> , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now that sounds about you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but they just trade out of apartments against the cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes , this already , but not the other half of them .
you could try to expand the capacity of existing apartments .
but you know what they were going to be in the way to avoid those apartments in these apartments and their environment have to avoid grievances and <unk> by <unk> .
so it turns out , it turns out , all of these were a very hard time .
but you could go to a new place , a whole new apartment block , provided the laws that would support for that and support it .
so i suggested that governments create new spaces that offer enough to a city and have a name : <unk> cities .
and i found that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> about the challenge of a reform in honduras .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 <unk> , their country to go in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could be doing to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same in honduras .
in this point , <unk> <unk> said , &quot; what happens if we &apos;re a <unk> area of our country , which if we &apos;re just a message from a message , a canadian <unk> , and when people are going to work out of the <unk> , a canadian <unk> and when people go work to the canadian rules or the united states , and then you can
in the summer 2009 , cbs had suffered severe <unk> .
in the next <unk> election , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a turnaround whose program promised us and and also <unk> promised .
he flew to <unk> on , his <unk> .
in the meantime , i was prepared to tedglobal in tedglobal .
in improvement , and try and study by the study of consumers , i tried to try this complicated concept of the city city to reduce the elements .
the first thing is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you don &apos;t have to <unk> existing <unk> .
we &apos;re giving great pay for new technologies , but for progress , it demands the and laws , and it &apos;s usually for common laws that await us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala , a <unk> player in a tedtalk .
and then , again , it showed him .
the two started calling me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s put the head of our country ! &quot;
so , we met in december of the <unk> of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , to how much more valuable they are as a cost .
and i &apos;ve used this chart to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york . think that a area in some cases per square meter of dollars thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion on a place when there was a pause , &quot; paul , could we think about the tedtalk . &quot;
so the ted posed is that a <unk> city is a place whose beginning is a <unk> , which defines the laws that are there to have the laws that have to live in the order or not yet .
and so that &apos;s been asked by the president of courage who meant that we need to realize this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way we get our country to get our country .
i was asked to come to <unk> , and i was going to be able to go on the fourth and fifth january of january a lecture .
so i have another <unk> talk to the , which has this has this thing that has to make sense that if you want to create a lot of a city , which has to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch it puts the new airport that was built in <unk> .
by this airport alone , this airport has 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> of that , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a field of at least 1,000 meters .
that &apos;s more than 250 acres .
<unk> all the <unk> .
the stories of the audience were very serious and paying attention .
the director of congress came up on the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at the ted tedtalk .
i have him to my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and you &apos;d play the ted story .
and i &apos;ve come to the line that a new city offers the people new opportunities .
there was the opportunity to live in a city that would be in honduras , instead of hundreds of miles away from north miles .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders .
the executives of the government in honduras were on <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , which they would be able to put in the <unk> for these <unk> for these <unk> and to implement that the charter is really going to be .
and the realization of president <unk> was that the confidence of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of getting to come and to build this city for all parties in honduras for all the way that we &apos;ve been under fear and mistrust .
we &apos;re in a field .
this is from this place .
it just sums up a thousand square kilometer .
and shortly after that , the 19th of january , they have voted on congress for a change in the constitution to have a <unk> policy that &apos;s for special <unk> <unk> .
in a country that has just a mild crisis , has been elected to the <unk> of that <unk> with a voice .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be <unk> twice by congress .
february 17th , it was a second time to <unk> with a <unk> .
immediately after that election , between the 21st-century and february 24th , one of the of about 30 <unk> of about 30 <unk> of the world that were most interested in the business of the <unk> .
the place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new downtown downtown , which built <unk> <unk> as a city of the city .
all of what you can see on this image , within four years , after four years , after four years to get permits to get permits .
the other place that was very interested in the urbanism is singapore .
it has built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re virtually seeing it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a <unk> , and you just consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a legal system that allows us to participate and it &apos;s also working on a legal legal system .
a country has offered to provide its supreme court , as court for the <unk> calling of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they actually bring funding to a .
one thing you already know , has been understood , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are many of these businesses who &apos;d like to be in in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who would like to live there .
over the world , there &apos;s 700 million people who say that they would like to live in a different place .
one million people left every year and go in the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to <unk> their families , sometimes they have single mothers who have to earn enough to eat food and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes they &apos;re sometimes kids who try to find their parents , in some cases , in some cases , they haven &apos;t seen it for a decade .
so what is it for a idea of thinking about thinking about how to build a new city of all of us ?
or even <unk> of these cities , or even hundreds of all around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist on that every family has a choice between a number of cities that are in competition to new people ?
that &apos;s an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from honduras to me , i asked to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many choices do you do about a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions are going to meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a survey recently with over 2,000 americans and the average number of decisions that are a typical americans on a day .
and also recently a study recently made a ceo in which she saw the ceo for a week .
and these scientists have been documented the different subjects that this ceo was busy , and how much time they spent decisions that are related to the subjects .
and they found that a average ceo was busy in the week with a <unk> work .
each of these subjects were , of course , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were being in from nine minutes or less .
it &apos;s only about 12 percent of their decisions , she needed an hour or more of their time .
think about their own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you are in the nine minutes of a person in the one hour ?
how do you think , are you to make decisions at all ?
today , i &apos;d like to talk about one of the greatest <unk> of our modern time , which is the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll give you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , please , you &apos;ll just raise your own , just your hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , so my first question for today is you &apos;re willing to hear anything about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a ph.d. at stanford university , i went to this very , and at least at the time he was really exclusive .
it was a store , the <unk> &apos;s called .
this is a business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and more than two dozen different types of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different types of water -- and that was too a time we actually have to have <unk> .
i loved it to this business ; i asked to a moment i asked myself , well , how does it is that you never have a little <unk> ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had these different kinds of olive oil , including those who were locked into boxes , which came from thousands of years of <unk> .
so i decided to visit the leader day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; works of this model that you can actually deliver all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the <unk> of tourists who came everyday and they were usually their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose to do our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> gait .
they had a different types of <unk> .
we put a little <unk> directly at the entrance at the <unk> .
we put six different flavors of a hundred different flavors or <unk> , and we put two things , and we &apos;ve got two things , first , i mean , what would be more people going to stay and more and <unk> ?
it &apos;s more people , and it &apos;s 24 , roughly 60 percent , when it were six , about 40 percent .
and then , after that , we saw in what the people were <unk> bought a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the <unk> effect .
and by the people who are left when they were 24 , they were only three percent of a glass of <unk> .
and by the people who are left , well , now we saw 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of <unk> .
well , if you do it , the people would have a <unk> glass , who they had six to choice when they had 24 to the selection .
now , to not buy a glass of <unk> , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the <unk> <unk> will be in very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even if it &apos;s about our own best interests .
so the theme of the day , financial save .
i &apos;m going to describe a study now that i was with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we &apos;re looking at the decisions for almost a million american plans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was if the number of <unk> that could be a <unk> , that is the <unk> , the likelihood that affect more tomorrow .
and we found that it was in fact there was a context in
so in this plans , we had about <unk> plans to give anything about anything between two to the <unk> of two to the other .
and what we found was that the more fund was being offered that , in fact , the communal rate was reduced .
now , if you look at the extremes of the plans to give the two fund , a <unk> in the 1970s -- still not as much as we want to do it .
in the mit , the almost 60 fund , the <unk> , the <unk> is about the <unk> <unk> .
now , imagine that even if you &apos;re going to participate in a <unk> , more choices to the , even , it has negative consequences .
so , the people who decided to participate , more that the more choices were available , the more that they were available to support and fund .
the more choices were available , the more they put their entire money in just just they were just in plain .
none of these extreme decisions , is to make the decisions that somebody recommend if you care about the future financial well-being matters .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve been watching people three critically negative consequences that brings up more and more choices .
they push the decision -- push them on , even if it &apos;s about their own interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse decisions -- worse medical benefits .
they &apos;re more willing to make them less happy , even if you make an objective better .
the main reason for this is that we might enjoy , we might enjoy all of us enjoy this huge <unk> of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we certainly can &apos;t move the interconnections and branching and then actually choose something out of the fantastic offer .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we tested in various ways and in different <unk> -- they can use them in their business .
first , just , narrow .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it never never ever heard true than today , that less more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; aside . &quot;
they always worry that they lose losing .
but in fact , we &apos;re more and more that if you &apos;re willing to narrow , and the <unk> <unk> opportunities , well , then there &apos;s a increase in sales , and it will be <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> improvement in the <unk> .
as a <unk> and gamble , the different <unk> , and <unk> species of 26 to 15 , they had a increase in sales to 2050 , and then it &apos;s going to increase 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> corporation , you were <unk> , they have to <unk> <unk> , they have to <unk> percent of the <unk> -- a result of the one that increase rise and sales and reducing costs .
you know , the average <unk> , today , is to give you about 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart is a <unk> of <unk> .
but the <unk> supermarket , the <unk> supermarket in the world is <unk> , and they &apos;re offering them to a mere <unk> -- a kind of tomato sauce in a crowd .
now in the world of the , i believe one of the best examples that come recently on the market , and how to the best the choice was something that david <unk> has a very strong <unk> , which is a program that &apos;s been offered to harvard .
every single harvard employees is automatically in a <unk> part .
those who are really going to make a choice , 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , as people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to do it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i &apos;m asking is , &quot; let me say , how the opportunities are different from each other .
and if you can &apos;t <unk> them , they can &apos;t get their customers . &quot;
now , before we &apos;ve started now before we &apos;ve got before , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all people in this audience , to be a <unk> vacation on the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read the reading .
and now i &apos;ll give you a couple seconds to read them and then i ask you clapping , if you &apos;re willing to take the <unk> &apos;s offering .
okay . everyone &apos;s ready to take the <unk> of the <unk> .
are all that ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve probably heard more hands .
good .
the fact is that it &apos;s objective , which is the first time , the first time , when the second time , but i would dare to guess it &apos;s real real time .
because the images made it feel real real .
what i do to do is bringing me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem with the problem , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about that people to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding , which consequences have been associated with the individual possibilities , and that have to be pretty specific to be a matter .
why are people about 15 to 30 percent more than if you use a <unk> or a card , as a <unk> ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you can do it , it feels a very good tool , so you &apos;re to save people to save more .
so we did in a study that i made with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve made a study with people in <unk> -- employees who all worked for the <unk> -- and these people were all in a gathering where they were placing their participation in the gathering of their <unk> .
and during the meeting , we &apos;ve been this gathering exactly the same time as they were , just we added a little bit .
the little thing that we have to do was that we asked to have people to think about all positive things that would happen in their lives , if they save money .
in that , we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation in the number of 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were ready to save a <unk> of four percent of the amount you were ready to pay for the <unk> .
third technology : <unk> .
we can deal with more categories than more than we can handle more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we did in a <unk> scanner .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> and down in the northeast of the number of magazines up to <unk> <unk> .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and you put it into 10 categories and i &apos;m giving you about 400 <unk> , and then you think that i &apos;ve given a better <unk> of a better <unk> than i have given the <unk> of a better <unk> than i have given the <unk> .
because the categories tell me how i can hold them apart .
here are two different types of <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other meaning &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left is <unk> , and the ad on the right is , you clap in the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that on the left is a jazz and the , on the right side , you clap please .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out that they &apos;re right .
the on the left is a jazz and the on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
the categories have to say something that is not about the selection .
and this problem is often when you look at the long list of all of these courses .
who do you actually to inform that ?
my fourth technology : the idea of complexity .
it turns out that we can avoid more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we have to increase the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> who offers the opportunity to <unk> your car to <unk> her car .
they have to make a lot of 62 decisions to design their car .
now these decisions are choices in the number of choices that provide them a choice .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i &apos;ve 56 ways .
engines , gears -- four ways .
what i do now is , i change the order to make decisions .
half of the clients is going to be , of the many possibilities , 56 <unk> , at the very few ways , to get four gears .
the other half of the customers is about the low possibilities , to the 56 , and the 56 <unk> , many possibilities .
what &apos;s what i &apos;m looking at ?
how are they are .
if you all the time you &apos;re all the <unk> on the decision , which is that you will be overwhelmed by , the <unk> , i lose it .
what you find is that the people who go from the many of the <unk> , and over and over again , the <unk> vote .
we lose them .
go from the very few choices to the many , then they remain .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did is the order to change the order in which this information is presented .
when i start with the simple , i &apos;m learning how i &apos;m <unk> .
even though that &apos;s even the gears , i don &apos;t have to pick up with my preferences , and i still chose to pick it on it .
it enables me to be looking at a lot of excitement that i &apos;m <unk> , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate me to be interested in being interested in the .
let me wrap up .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques , the the problem of <unk> <unk> -- just -- will they get the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- do it real ; we categorize it real ; we can put better in , less possibilities ; we &apos;re going to prepare for the complexity .
and each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you to help the possibilities -- well for you , you can use them for themselves , good for people who they provide services to provide them well for the people who they provide services .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re choosing .
and the more we pick up and pick , the better we will be able to practice the art of the decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , i &apos;m looking at youtube . i &apos;m looking at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how video <unk> will be , and then , why it &apos;s important .
we all like to be stars -- <unk> , singer , comedians -- when i was young , who seemed so difficult to be so difficult .
but <unk> is that we all have to all of our creative activities , all of our creative activities in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to next saturday .
but at youtube , you &apos;ll have to give more than 48 hours a minute .
again , just a tiny percentage ever is ever , and will get thousands of times and so the cultural moment .
so how does that work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , we want to go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> video , which he filmed in the national national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked like the video last summer , the the video last summer was popular .
actually , doesn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing this , when you &apos;re a yosemite called a mountain .
he had uploaded every crowd .
and this video was actually been sent in january of january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
and there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that &apos;s what the video was so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> are giving us new and interesting things , and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> on <unk> . <unk> &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
rebecca <unk> &quot; is one of the most popular video of the year .
it was nearly 200 million times .
this is what the graph looked like .
it seems like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems to be coming out of nowhere .
what &apos;s happened to this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other tips are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
now , <unk> <unk> , it started writing about it .
michael j. nelson , from the <unk> science , was a first one who made a joke with a joke .
what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of <unk> has a a point with a big audience , and that <unk> <unk> .
then , those community formed , these community built shared this big <unk> , and started talking about it and to playing with it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parody for every single day of the day .
unlike the most exciting entertainment , the part of the community &apos;s part of the part of the community , is the part of the phenomenon -- either by taking it spread or something new .
&quot; <unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s just easy .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you think that crazy for crazy , you &apos;d like to know that there &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> that was viewed for four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at a cats that look at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that has been in the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
it was brought back .
somebody made an unprecedented version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot from the ground that it made it from a stupid joke to something that we all can participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find some pleasure on something we do .
who could have afforded to anticipate ?
who would have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or rebecca or &quot; <unk> black or &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; ?
what <unk> did have been able to write in those things that ?
in a world , in the every minute , two days , two days , can only be a unique and unexpected <unk> as the i would just playing video .
i &apos;m not a very much been very much interested in my friend , and a friend said , i would have to look at this great video about a guy who protested the new york for a <unk> for the <unk> .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not on the <unk> <unk> , but often there &apos;s a lot of disability that drive a decent to <unk> .
because it was surprising and humorous , was a casey <unk> fun idea and his argument five million times .
this approach is all of the things we &apos;re creative .
and that &apos;s all leads to the big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , totally unexpected , is the features of a new kind of media and culture , and that has to all the and in the audience who are destined to be <unk> .
like , one of the most of the stars -- a justin bieber -- did his start with youtube .
no one has to give your ideas green light .
and today we are also , as the owners of our culture culture .
and that &apos;s not the features of the old media and they don &apos;t even make them to the media from today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the bond between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness is a <unk> girl , when she &apos;s going to talk about 30 years ago , and she &apos;s never going to talk about this little girl , and he &apos;s talking about it ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s going to be put together .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who &apos;s going to be burning his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man who was held by the simple hope of oneness and freedom of its home .
if you think it <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , as he has to admit that his life was a single waste .
the words , so long , his friends , <unk> , well .
he moved into silence .
he died , killed by the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories are .
my grandmother never have to be missed me .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that story was trying to do , we &apos;re going to be coming out of us , but it &apos;s coming off .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> silent <unk> .
my mother may may be 18 , when her father died -- before , in a marriage marriage , already with two little girls .
for her life , her job was asking her job : the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely accident that it could fail .
after a four-year-old , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat to the lake , as <unk> .
the adults were aware of the risk .
the biggest fear had they were <unk> , rape and death .
like the adults on the boat was carrying a little <unk> .
in a <unk> , my sister and i , then she , and then she &apos;s offering her and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady <unk> of motors that puts up every wave on the front of the long and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came to be a lot of times , but from the <unk> of the men on our boat , or on the <unk> of the engine , the six hours .
but i remember the lights of the <unk> off the coast of <unk> , and the young man who broke down and died , the end of the first <unk> of the first <unk> of the first <unk> that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple tasted that tasted it .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in in melbourne .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations , who are together a new life .
we settled down in <unk> , a of the working-class <unk> on the <unk> of the population of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was totally unknown , there was no <unk> <unk> .
the smells out of the <unk> , from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> , the <unk> , between people who had shared , who had one thing together : they started fresh .
my mother was working farms , then on a line of a line of <unk> , six days , twice twice .
and it was able to find their time to find english and <unk> .
we were poor .
and every dollar has been given , and i was put in education for english and mathematics , whatever we had to get rid of this , mostly the new things that came to come from a second .
two couple of <unk> for the school , every to cover the holes in the other in the way .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to reach six years .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> , &quot; and there &apos;s <unk> , &quot; and there &apos;s <unk> , &quot;
after where ?
something else in me .
there was a meeting to the reconciliation and a calm voice , said , &quot; i &apos;ll go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and they heard the movements of our grandmother &apos;s the house .
my mother was from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job , every night , to stay awake until their <unk> , so i could get her <unk> .
she opened a <unk> , then he was a business , and he opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t the change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , trapped between two worlds .
and loans were looking for loans and sponsors .
and the <unk> .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian student who asked a <unk> community .
in the other , i was involved in uncertain life , the tragic scars of violence wore the <unk> and the insulation .
but so many got the for the years .
and because of this aid , i was <unk> in my last year as a boy <unk> of the year .
and i was going to <unk> to the nearest <unk> , and the edges of it doesn &apos;t .
<unk> le , blind <unk> of <unk> , was <unk> <unk> , refugee and social activist who was invited to the lectures of places that they never heard about , and in homes , whose existence never had ever imagined .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go routine and the comfort of life of a solitary <unk> -- a mother and two daughters , who were the <unk> of their day , and they were telling each other stories of their day and <unk> , we still three and the same bed .
i said my mother , i would not create it .
she reminded me that i was so old as she was when we were burning the boat .
no one was never a option .
&quot; do it just said , &quot; she said , &quot; and not , what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i was talking about <unk> and education , and the neglect of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i talked about , the more i should tell .
i met people in all of the <unk> , so many of them did what they loved to the borders of the possible .
and although i had close to my degree , i realized that i could not contend with a career in my active .
there had to be another <unk> of <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , new in the image -- and not just fine , but something that you have to be grateful to be so , perhaps a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can lead to collapse for collapse , so easily , that you &apos;re accepted the assumptions of the environment .
now i went to have enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world , but not as you &apos;re <unk> it .
the ways that hasn &apos;t been allowed , i &apos;ve been encouraged to be explicitly .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of the humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut gut .
i collected a little team of people to the <unk> , &quot; the <unk> of the story was not .
a year we had no cents .
at the end of one , i cooking a giant empty soup we shared us .
we worked until the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the united states .
after just a trip there .
my gut gut gut .
three months later , i moved to the adventure on the day .
before i <unk> the lecture , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time in which he was the social norm and the local mandarin would be the most important person .
life hasn &apos;t changed for centuries .
her father died of her birth .
her mother , she passed on .
and then , with 17 , they were the second woman in the mandarin who she was her .
without their husband &apos;s given worried she cared for a <unk> , by making him in trial and <unk> in her own case , and a larger <unk> of <unk> than she won .
&quot; is not &quot; proved to be <unk> .
i just <unk> in a room room in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and saw it on the other side .
i knew she came to be goodbye to speak .
my mother would have me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went in a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her coffin .
we told her stories and <unk> her , we were still in her .
and at midnight , the monk , he said , he had to close the <unk> .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they hold it for the morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t break them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through the women .
if you see who we were , and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who might come in our lives , they &apos;d come in the <unk> .
the defeat was too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i think about the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yes , i was scared of <unk> , <unk> , before <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the brave and the wave , the <unk> , steady of the engine , the vast horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and you could make it <unk> , i would do it .
and then , <unk> mother is now in the fourth or fifth .
i &apos;m here to share my photography .
is it in flight ?
because this is of course , a picture that you can &apos;t pick up with the camera .
and yet , i started to me , i was my first digital camera , at the age of 15 years .
i put it with my previous <unk> for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because using the camera , the camera was in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends , if you squeeze it to trigger .
so , it seemed to me to go to the art of the right place at the right time .
i believed that everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , which is where the trigger is going to trigger .
pictures like this : a site , a a a lot of <unk> street .
but it &apos;s a kind of a bit of a bit .
and still still a realistic level .
or pictures like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all of the open-heart purpose to keep a realistic space .
when i say , i mean , i &apos;m going to go out .
because , of course , she &apos;s not something that can actually catch , but i want to look like this , as if you could have it that , on a photograph .
and the photos that you have to think about a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so , it &apos;s more about to capture an idea when a really moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details , or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what does the illusion ?
sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
but then , finally , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be done on a two-dimensional type of material .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think about realistic .
so i think the essentials are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality that you can take different pieces and put together and create a alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect <unk> of the physical objects that we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , they can combine something that is still in a bit more three-dimensional than if it could exist .
but at the same time we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brains don &apos;t accept not really , it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about the things we &apos;re in our day-to-day lives .
but if we combine pictures , it really important to think about it , because you just look wrong with it .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to the <unk> to achieve a more precise outcome .
as you can see , they &apos;re not three special pictures .
so , but can you put something special as this .
so the first rule is that made of the things have the same perspective .
second , put together pictures of the same <unk> .
and these two pictures will satisfy these two requirements -- from the same <unk> and the same <unk> .
and thirdly , it &apos;s not impossible to do it to be different where the individual images start and end by using it seamlessly .
it &apos;s impossible to say , like this was actually put together .
so by looking color , contrast and contrast to the edge of the individual images , photographic <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> colors and dysfunction , we can see the borders between the different images and and you can make the limitations of the different images , and you see a single picture of which is basically hundreds of planes .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is a landscape , and the bottom is being manipulated .
this image is completely composed , from pictures of different places .
i personally , i personally think it is easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise a compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew i needed to take several months to try to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> asylum .
the shore is from a different place .
the <unk> comes from a quarry .
and yes , i actually have the house on the island of red , to look at it .
to get a <unk> outcome , it &apos;s coming out of <unk> .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a very good thing to do this .
and if you make good footage , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so , there are all tools to do , and the only thing that are limited , is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think that the most important thing is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve been in the <unk> , was a <unk> .
and it &apos;s not particularly particularly scientifically -- you can go to a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patient , families , relatives , &quot; how about it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the problems that everybody -- maybe the most of the electronic <unk> <unk> is failing , because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i jump .
and yeah , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i have my job to 95 to the 95 of the <unk> .
it &apos;s just going to work on every time i get to the libra , then send it to google health .
and there &apos;s also going to be in my <unk> <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , not just in the moment where i <unk> <unk> , but also a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know , you know , i &apos;ve got 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i jump up to my <unk> and people , and i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; lunch lunch just rather than a little salad on the <unk> . &quot;
but this is what &apos;s the <unk> thing that can happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be used to the patient &apos;s smoking .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs and to get them to play in common with any kind of play to control your health .
every week , it comes to the market .
and it will give this little <unk> of <unk> that you &apos;re going to an iphone or so <unk> .
and it will allow people to do their blood pressure from home to try to send it to your doctor and for example , for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
at that point , the patient can go to play . you can &apos;t just take control , <unk> on their own ship , but can help us in healthcare with the challenges that are in front of us , and the health of healthcare , the world , and the more public health , twice the world , and so on .
make them to do that easy to use and start with this to hug the patient in the team .
and that can do it through these things , but also by <unk> .
and one of the things we did , i &apos;d like to share with you with a quick video .
we &apos;ve all got <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our phones .
we know exactly where all the atm machines are around .
we know one of where all petrol stations are .
and we can see <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next <unk> was to find in this moment .
so what did we do ? we did bridges in the netherlands .
we set up a website and a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share us where he &apos;s when he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed in the <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> have been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps .
and we designed a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , augmented reality to find this <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and somebody down to lay down , can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you can also find their <unk> to find the next to the next to the lives of life .
and let &apos;s not like to do this is not just as a <unk> , as a product called it , but also as a <unk> .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like <unk> to crowdsource these <unk> in the world .
and if you &apos;re on vacation and you &apos;re down , it &apos;s your own relationships or somebody else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing we want to ask is is that companies are helping us to help us in the world of these <unk> .
and that might be <unk> , or , or , for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still in the place .
please , please help us and try to improve the health , not just to improve the hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report by unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> , to make us make us to make it .
... it &apos;s been giving you to crowdsource .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh , a moment .
it &apos;s maybe it &apos;s <unk> until it &apos;s <unk> .
now , we can just jump -- i &apos;ll just jump the video .
no .
it &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> ...
oh , my time is gone ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago i started a program to take the stars in technology and design to take a year and work in a environment that is so pretty much everything they hate , we &apos;ve got them in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little like the <unk> of furniture .
we choose a few of fellows , and we &apos;re working with a <unk> .
instead of sending them in the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and they developed great apps working with a city of collaborators .
but what you really do is to show what is possible with technology .
so , you meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
this is what he looks like a date , but what he &apos;s looking for a date , somebody who <unk> him , when he &apos;s <unk> , he &apos;s not very well in the <unk> when he &apos;s <unk> .
how did he did to look at this particular kind of thing ?
and we had a team of fellows in boston , the code for america .
they were in february , and it has a lot of <unk> .
and they found that the city never have these fire hydrant .
but one particular fellow , a man called erik <unk> , who noticed something else , and that was that the residents who the iraqis are free , right before these sharing .
so he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you <unk> to him <unk> , if it &apos;s <unk> .
if you &apos;re doing that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away from it .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a very small thing .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that wrote in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other .
it &apos;s spreading out .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> center of the city who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizens of <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but the people steal things the batteries .
so he got the citizen to check them .
and then , seattle , the app that was to use the citizens to get the <unk> <unk> .
and chicago has just introduced , so that people who <unk> the <unk> when it &apos;s <unk> .
we know nine cities , the planning to use this app .
and it &apos;s been <unk> organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually go .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team that was working on a project last year in boston , for three people , and they needed a half months .
it was about a method of the parents who are the right public schools for their children .
and we later told later that if it would go across the normal channels , it took over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not anything .
there &apos;s a project in the california justice , which has to have two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of the government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then it &apos;s spreading from <unk> , is a kind of shot on the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could do better -- not more like a private company , how many people think that she should be .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , that means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , that is that they represented a new generation , which is the problem of government -- not as a problem of an <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out that we are very well in the collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to do to make things effectively effectively .
it &apos;s not just the code for america , there are hundreds of people in all the country , and you get up and write , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t have given the government .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they fix them .
and these people know what we lost in the eyes .
and that &apos;s what if you all forget about politics and the snake and all the other things that we forget about is government , in the core , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we do in together we can &apos;t do that alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people who left up on the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please , you know that you &apos;re going to go through it , because things are changing .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in the change .
and because the government will ultimately give us their power -- <unk> you , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government than i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it was mainly in the government to vote for people in office .
now , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s about local communities .
this is the call call on service and information .
you know , you know , if you &apos;re in your city of <unk> .
if you ever have the chance to work in your <unk> call , like our fellow scott <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re doing that all -- you &apos;re going to call that -- you &apos;re going to call that the government of many different problems , including that a <unk> in your house .
scott gets this <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official .
and he doesn &apos;t really an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open the doors in your house and you can see very sounds , play , if you &apos;re going to be <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
now , boston is not just a call call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t written this app .
this is a work very smart people in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is a australian report -- it came in : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> , can &apos;t say if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; is different .
scott talked to human being human conversation .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all the public , so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it looked a neighbor .
and the next one that we get said , &quot; i went over there , i found the carcass behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ?
and the <unk> on the page . went home .
good night , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here is the digital physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government get to <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean , a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government was played to a central role .
they connected these two people .
and you could have connect them with government , if they were needed , but a neighbor is a very much better and cheaper alternative to government services .
and if one neighbor is to help , we sustain our communities .
let &apos;s summon the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things we have to think is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but you think that one is the input of the other .
that our contributions to the system is to vote .
how often we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we use a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re going back to us , the government , embracing our values and our needs , and then it hasn &apos;t change ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a wider ocean and politics is the supreme <unk> .
and what is underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we have , and for whom we are paying something that is to us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves ourselves .
people seem to think , is sexy .
if we want this institution for us , we have to make the bureaucratic sexy .
because that is where the actual <unk> is happening .
we need to be to the machinery of the government .
so the <unk> has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group concerned about <unk> , which has written a very detailed <unk> report that has an answer to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not politically , that &apos;s active active .
now , for those of us who have given up the government is time we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you &apos;ve got to give you the enormous challenges of you to imagine .
do we really believe that we &apos;re going to do what we need to do without the institution that can be in the name of us ?
and a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficiently .
the good news is that technology is possible to do that , the function of the government is fundamentally in a way that can actually achieve a difference by society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up up , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you need to build the things properly .
now the average age of our fellows &apos;s 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with a of course , to see her voice .
they don &apos;t fight this struggle that we all struggle to be talking about who &apos;s allowed to speak ; you all can talk to .
you can make them on their opinion , at every channel , and they do it .
so if you &apos;re faced with the problem with government , you don &apos;t care so much about their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improves the work of the government .
and these apps , let &apos;s use our hands to improve our communities .
it could be a <unk> fire , weed a cans of a cans of a <unk> pad .
and sure , we would have these <unk> fire that have been able to <unk> the whole wall , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we are not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers who are willing to pay taxes .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we will not improve government to save the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all here is : when it &apos;s the big things that we need to do , all together , we &apos;re all together a lot of voices , we will be a lot of hands , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
it &apos;s usually my role in that to explain people like wonderful , the new technologies that are being on the are being , and i thought , i &apos;m here to see , i &apos;m here in friends , i would tell you what this quickly happen quickly .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single quick slide .
... if you could show the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve chosen to my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather to the general form .
this slide is data from a analysis of the performance of <unk> processors compared to the performance of a viable area .
and the interesting here is that this slide , like some other , which we find find in our field , a kind of a <unk> curve .
in other words , each step here is a potency in the <unk> .
and this is a novelty , that we have to use this type scale on <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something very strange thing is happening here .
so this is basically what i &apos;m talking about here .
so if you could go back to turn the lights back .
even a little bit brighter , because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper on paper .
now , why do we draw on the <unk> of <unk> curves ?
the reason for that , if i would draw it on a normal curve , where we say that here are the years , so the timeline of a way , and that is an ant amount of technology that i want to describe to a graph , which is is a graph is ridiculous .
and then the look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to draw another technology , we &apos;ll say a <unk> , then that would come on the <unk> scale of very <unk> in form a flat line .
but if something like this is happening , it changes the most important thing .
so if the <unk> was so fast as the <unk> dynamic , then we could put in a taxi in a taxi and in 30 seconds we were in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
that was never before in the history of the <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which is the scale of the the scale of the two years .
now the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this latent curves , you can &apos;t get it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that it &apos;s all forever and forever , as long as it now .
there are two options .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic <unk> of like this to something completely new , or it will be happening here .
that &apos;s it in about .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is what &apos;s going to happen .
it &apos;s really so , then that means , we &apos;re in the right now in the right now .
we &apos;re here in this line , in a transition from the world in a new way of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i &apos;m a lot of myself , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new state to take the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing when you &apos;re in in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and the year 2000 , and people talked about what was going to happen in 2000 .
now , we now have a conference here where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
and beyond that , we &apos;re going to go .
so in other words , the future is dramatically since i &apos;ve been since this world .
i think the reason is that we realize is something that is going on .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that it &apos;s not a sense of trying to try and look at the future , and you know , for 50 years into the future , because everything is so different from what we &apos;re making is simply not make sense .
so i want to talk about what this is that convergence in which we &apos;re in .
to do this to do this , i first talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have to do with technology or computers .
because i think about this to really understand this , we need to step back and look at it on a longer <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at this on the <unk> of life of earth .
i think the big picture makes sense , if you divided it into some <unk> .
so , we go back , and a half billion years . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals .
now , if you were looking at the way these chemicals were organized , then we have a pretty good image about how they do the <unk> .
and i also think there are theories that start to understand how to paint , but i &apos;m going to share a little story about what is that time little <unk> <unk> , which is that various kinds of chemicals in chemicals in <unk> .
some of these <unk> <unk> has a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and so growing .
all the ones were all the way , the general .
these little <unk> of <unk> were the <unk> <unk> .
but , these <unk> weren &apos;t about living in the same , because every single one of them was just a small , <unk> prescription recipe by chemicals .
and every time it divided , the <unk> of chemicals in the <unk> of chemicals .
so every <unk> was a little different .
in fact , the <unk> , which had a <unk> of growth , more than other and integrated and more chemicals from the outside and shared faster .
so , these already , it , it , and they were <unk> to an <unk> degree .
so that &apos;s just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , it &apos;s going to have a trick about abstraction .
in any ways we don &apos;t quite understand that , this <unk> <unk> capacity to <unk> information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe recipe for the cell , and in a certain chemical form , which we call dna .
in other words , they have found in this <unk> , evolutionary way that allowed them to be made of what they were made , so that this information could be stored and and copied this .
the amazing thing about that this kind of thing is that this kind of information to store that kind of information that they came in with a second , the same thing .
in fact , the recipe recipe for us , which is our genes , which is exactly the same code and the same notation .
and every creatures , the same letters , and the same code .
we &apos;re so far that we can write , in the code , can write in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i try to keep in airports of <unk> .
it &apos;s -- what i did is , i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to the <unk> -- and i wrote my <unk> on a piece of dna , and it was 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone would like to do a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough to everyone in this room and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s exactly here .
if i was actually a <unk> , and then i would have it written in a virus and opened it into the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where the things were completely different , and that was actually starting to share these cells to communicate and share information , so communities originate .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually share their dna .
that &apos;s also why the optical antibiotics is growing .
some bacteria figured out how they can come from penicillin , and have this information together with other bacteria into dna , and now we have any bunch of bacteria which are hijacked on penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
so , this is allowed to do this in the reasons of communities which were in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either survived together , or they went together under . that meant that if a community was successful , all individuals who had been more often more than than repeatedly and by evolution .
the <unk> is now where these communities so close to the <unk> that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a <unk> of the dna .
and the next interesting thing took about a billion years .
at that point , we have <unk> communities , communities from many <unk> <unk> , which are together as individual organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not being on their own .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , cells cells , brain cells , etc .
so these communities started so that the level on which the evolution was going on , not longer the single cell , but the whole thing that we call it .
next step is happening within these communities .
the <unk> started to do information .
and they developed special structures which made nothing else to process as being information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> of the that these <unk> <unk> .
they were starting to train in specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning to learn , understand and that on information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learn within the time of life , of an individual organism , rather than about this evolutionary period .
so , an organism could learn a particular fruit , because she liked and sick , she liked it , the last time he ate her .
this was actually a single organism in the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because that information had to be learned from the individuals because of these fruit were still not there .
so the nervous system has this particular <unk> using this particular <unk> because evolution could be happening within a single single range .
it could take place within a time of time .
what after that after that , is that the individual organisms that we found was to communicate with each other .
for example , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of this <unk> is the human language .
it &apos;s a very intriguing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complex , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically , <unk> notes of me in the hope of that <unk> idea in your head that a resemblance to my original idea .
so we take a little bit complicated , it puts it in sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to be a kind of an analog to work .
and what we actually did , we &apos;ve got humanity , we &apos;ve started to abstract .
we &apos;re going to go through the same stages , which have been through the <unk> -- the abstraction of our methods we can hold on , we can process it .
so the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , and so on these are our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to deal with this information .
and it connects us to something that is much bigger , and also is capable of evolve faster than we were so far .
so today , evolution can happen in the time period of the time period .
you &apos;ve also seen a little <unk> <unk> , where he has shown a little evolution in the &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; your eyes .
so now we have the <unk> again again .
the first step of story i told you , <unk> a billion years a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a hundred hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to take few decades .
and the process is feeding itself and become , so i think , is the word for it -- if something its <unk> <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that feed itself .
i live living from the building of computers , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism i use using computers , without the last few of the progress in computing .
my current thing is to design objects with such a lot of a lot that it &apos;s impossible to design these in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what the designers do , and what the designers are doing , we think about a certain <unk> , to this machine , and the machine makes something that makes our ability to grow , better and faster than we could ever do it ourselves .
and it &apos;s partly to do with methods that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a method which is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been used in the last time is evolution itself .
and in fact , we put a <unk> in the machine which is in the <unk> .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program which is evolved from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , please bring a hundred million randomly sequences of instructions .
now , all of these randomly chosen to take the instructions , and i &apos;ll pick those , which are the closest to my goals are the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want to do .
let &apos;s say , i &apos;m going to say , i want to be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for it .
so , in fact , programs that can be most likely numbers .
of course , the chance of randomly chosen to be very small , that it &apos;s very accidental number numbers , so that &apos;s probably not going to do the instructions .
but one of them may have two numbers into the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take those 10 percent of the sequences that have to come on the next .
it &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> the rest .
now , all the <unk> , the number of <unk> , the numbers of the best .
and that is a method of the <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children by exchange of their <unk> , and the children are the the the features of the <unk> of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs which are something closer to the target than others .
please say , &quot; please , this process . &quot;
<unk> them .
but maybe some mutations .
and try it another generation .
all of these generations , few milliseconds .
and so i can undergo evolution over millions of years in the computer , and in more complicated , several hours .
and finally , i get programs to get the numbers perfect .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i can have ever write .
and if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s miserable and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job because they come from a series of <unk> programs that come to the job .
because their lives depended on , they were doing the job right .
i sat in a 747 in a 747 in a 747 <unk> , he <unk> a card , and says , &quot; look . look at it .
there is , &quot; this airplane is made of <unk> <unk> , which are working together to make their flight safer . &apos; does it doesn &apos;t <unk> you ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not optimal , when it becomes too complicated .
so we start to the computer , to do a process which is very different from the classical technology .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow us to produce a normal methods .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it .
so <unk> <unk> us technology .
we &apos;re using these programs to do the computers , so that we can be able to do this more possible faster .
so it creates a <unk> .
it &apos;s going faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies from themselves today are feeding .
we put up .
we &apos;ve come to a point , which is to be developed by <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t make up , what &apos;s hell we &apos;re actually building .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that after us is something .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> of us to say that we are the end of evolution .
and i think we all have part of the creation of the creation of what comes next .
now , the lunch is before , and i &apos;m thinking , here before i &apos;m going to go back to .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about that nothing has been changed since the time of the ancient indian <unk> . &quot;
if indians were going to travel , we went to a car and <unk> over the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
then , when the great indian <unk> <unk> thirst , he took a bow , she pulled into the ground and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic with machines were replaced .
that really really sad .
i got a little bit of fear of technology .
it was me to me that i could lose the ability to have the <unk> , and you can &apos;t get rid of the <unk> , without tweet about my friends .
i found that technology should be possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
she was a <unk> access to a world of pirates to a world of pirates and <unk> and to images in my imagination .
i was so like , we thought , and we thought our fancy clocks and and the cameras of it .
they thought of being inspired by being being inspired .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing .
and i started to illustrate books to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling , the <unk> reader in the world .
it can know how we think it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s bringing images and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
that storytelling is always more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to <unk> , an interactive ipad .
here &apos;s &quot; put your finger on every light . &quot;
and so -- here says , &quot; this box is &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;ll find a figure out of the book .
and again , a letter to me down to me -- and the ipad know , through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child is really excited about this , and that &apos;s really excited about this .
i talked a lot about magic .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean , and kites , but the magic of childhood , the the the ideas that we all had to do .
it &apos;s a very exciting one in a glass , and i found it very exciting .
so you have to blow the &quot; the ipad and the <unk> .
and the light on the way through the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in a single single .
and so here &apos;s why every one of the world , and every world is a little <unk> that i salute here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always maps , but these maps were static .
this is growing and it &apos;s <unk> and it &apos;s an <unk> of the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also showing at other places .
i &apos;ll go in here .
it &apos;s also important to me , to do something that is that <unk> is also very <unk> .
this is the <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve heard all of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were trapped thousands of years in <unk> rooms in a ancient <unk> of book .
and we bring them back to a contemporary story for children .
a story that were starting to have a new business , like the <unk> .
the theme of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children in their rooms in their rooms , and they &apos;re sitting out of their computers , without leaving .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children in the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction , you &apos;re going to search for a search . you have to go out and with the camera of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
as a kid , i had collections of collections , stones , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow , the children don &apos;t do anymore .
this is <unk> <unk> . you have to go out to a chapter one of a flower and to tag a photograph of a flower .
in another chapter , you have to tag a piece of <unk> <unk> and tag .
so , you actually create digital collection of photographs that can you online .
a kid in london shows the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; today i saw a monkeys . &quot;
that creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that actually actually recorded .
there are lots of ways of the ways to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning to take interaction with the video and through <unk> reality version of <unk> that appear on a plant in front of the house .
there &apos;s a place , the screen downloads with the leaves .
you have to do the sound of the <unk> , you will blow it and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the forces of the technology are closer and and in the magic and technology can be at .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and closer to the natural world , and on the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the very simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a tremendous honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest and in places where there are very much .
here to be here at ted , to see , and to hear , how stimulated it is , has given me a lot of force .
in the short time , i &apos;m a clear story : ted has an identity .
you can tell things that the world &apos;s influence .
and sometimes , if something about ted comes , it gets a meaning and force that it wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher , but the words of a passionate profession are meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor doctor , but you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn by a lawyer in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i was a big in a family , a traditional <unk> household who was dominated by a <unk> , and that <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had an effect .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the starting of a lot of living in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in virginia than slave .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped a lot .
my grandmother was very strong , but she was also loving .
if i met her as a little boy , she came to me and <unk> me .
she also reminded me that i could breathe , and then she left me .
one or two hours later , if i walked , she came to me and said , &quot; whoa , feel you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i say no , &quot; she said me , &quot; if i said , &quot; i said , &quot; she left me in silence .
her was something that was made , that you &apos;d always wanted to be near her .
the only thing that was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins all walked around .
i remember , i have to have eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and went into the living room . all my cousins were wandering around .
my grandmother sat at the end of the <unk> , and i stared at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
and i looked at her and smiled , but she was very serious .
that went so 15 or 20 minutes . and she stood up and came to me over and she took me in the hand and said , &quot; come , you know , you know , you know , we need to talk .
i remember that when it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me to go out after and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to promise you you &apos;re not going to be <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me , and she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i will never forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise to me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , when you know , &quot; first of you , you know , you &apos;re going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; mom &apos;s my baby , and you &apos;ve got to promise you &apos;re going to care about it . &quot;
i &apos;m dragging my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next thing is that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , and i said , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise is &quot; that you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother went home and took this dejected beer with me and went to the woods .
we &apos;re just as as you as well .
and he took a <unk> beer and volunteered to me , and she took , and then offering me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . do you . i don &apos;t want to beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do we do this , today we &apos;re doing that , and all we do anything we do .
i had what your sister had , what was going to do , and go a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do . make her just . &quot;
my brother at me staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? well , what &apos;s going to you ?
and then he looked at me , and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t still have crazy for the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody , that they are special . &quot;
i was devastated the ground .
i &apos;m going to be a little bit .
i should not be doing that .
this is probably the public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;ll <unk> that i &apos;ve never drinking a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say that &apos;s identity is power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people to tell us things that they don &apos;t think they &apos;re about .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was in the prison prison in prison .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and they believed that these are the subjects to take care of us .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in <unk> and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest <unk> of the world today .
seven million people are left on <unk> or with <unk> <unk> .
i think , in fact , have changed our world fundamentally changed .
in social , and black parts of the population are borderless despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , in <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities everywhere , in los angeles , over philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black men in prison , in prison , in <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
and our system will not just be shaped by asking the <unk> that is also by poverty .
we have a <unk> <unk> that treated them much better when they &apos;re rich and guilty of being poor and guilty .
fortune , not influenced , it affects the result .
but still , we seem to be very pleased with it .
and a politics of fear and anger , we believed that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost contact .
i find that interesting .
there &apos;s some more of these things .
my home state pulls , permanently <unk> the <unk> if they &apos;re <unk> .
here , in alabama , in alabama , 34 percent of the first-born black black population permanently permanently lost their lost .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the average of the average of the average , the average of the average <unk> is as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the <unk> children in prison .
in this our country , there &apos;s children <unk> <unk> without genetic <unk> .
we &apos;ve done a lot of work .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we think , because we &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : did a man deserves to die for a man &apos;s <unk> crimes ?
it &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how to see our identity .
the other view is not : did someone deserves a crimes of death , but we did it deserve to kill ?
i find that fascinating .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people that we &apos;ve been executed , one that we &apos;ve been to find a innocent institution that was released and from the death row .
an amazing <unk> . one of the nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never fly somebody with a plane if for nine planes , the boat .
but somehow we can do it , from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;ve got my students &apos; african-american history . i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time to the end of the second , until the beginning of the second world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the people who was in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror , which shaped her life .
these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr , <unk> , you talk , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking about , you know that we &apos;ve got to do it in the history of our nation to do with terrorism , after 9 / 11 .
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> motivated judgment and apartheid .
and yet , there is a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what meaning meaning what our did have been in the historical context .
we &apos;re all the time .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach to the process of truth and reconciliation .
in southern africa , people understood that the <unk> is not to stop the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , they were on this , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve kept some of the talks in germany , and the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientist said , after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s profoundly disturbing to hear you so talk . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , you can never give it in germany . &quot;
it was silent . then she said a woman , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible we ever killing us to make the systematic systematic of people .
it would be <unk> of us , and deliberately and find people . &quot;
i thought about it .
what it would feel like to live in a world where the german state <unk> , especially if there were many jews .
it would be stigmatizing .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we &apos;re putting people down -- here &apos;s the risk of being a death of death , 11 times higher when the <unk> knows the body of the body of the body <unk> people .
and yet there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is under threat .
if we &apos;re not dealing with this with these difficult subjects , then the positive and wonderful things also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are suffering from suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
and i think it seems to combine both both together .
because we &apos;ll tell you that we need more hope more commitment , more commitment , more commitment , to be in a complex world .
for me , that means time to do that , and to talk about the poor , the <unk> , who are never going to be at ted .
but think of a way that is integrated in our own lives .
we all have to believe the last time we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we are rational as well as we are .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming from our heads .
they come from ideas , that will be driven by the conviction in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i think that is not just open to all the bright and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians , once said , once .
&quot; as we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to be all possible , but what we needed was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be in more places , sometimes being witnessed in places . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core whose core of which i think that is also going to engage in this .
there &apos;s no evidence of it to be technology and design that allows us to be very , and it &apos;s not as long as we don &apos;t even have eyes and ears have poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges very much more than if we don &apos;t care about it .
she will touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i was a big privileged to meet with the <unk> park .
<unk> parks , again , back after <unk> , where they were two of their oldest friends , <unk> <unk> , who had had the <unk> <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a white , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women were meeting and they were a very <unk> .
and i was a lady and then , and i said , &quot; <unk> , woman comes in the city . we want to talk .
do you want to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very , very much . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what will you do if they &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m listening to listen . &quot;
and i went over and just too .
it was so inspiring , so , it was so inspiring .
and one day , i sat there and i was talking to a few hours , and a few hours , and she was to me , &quot; well , &quot; well , tell me what the commitment to the same is .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go to the injustice of
liespotters want people to help people who were convicted of being convicted .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to eradicate <unk> <unk> without any genetic child for children .
we want to do something against the death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of death .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> .
she said , &quot; this is very , very tired . &quot;
and then , she sat himself to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why they have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted ted ted ted was supposed to be <unk> .
we need to give us to give us to these challenges : these problems , that &apos;s suffering .
because ultimately our humanity , from our humanity &apos;s humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
we &apos;re all more , as the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that applies for every people on the planet .
if someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone else takes something that doesn &apos;t hear it , it &apos;s not just a thief .
even who kills someone who &apos;s not a killer .
and because that &apos;s so , there &apos;s a fundamental human being that needs to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that in many places , i think there is the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so stimulating , we &apos;re not measured by the of our technology , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not in our intellect and minds .
and finally , a society is not measuring how they &apos;re treating their rich and powerful and privileged , but to how they deal with the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the real amazing things that make us .
sometimes i lose that balance . a story .
sometimes i urge to get .
i &apos;m tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas are <unk> , our thinking , in a very important way .
i was these kids who were very hard punishment .
i &apos;m going to go to the <unk> and visit to the <unk> who might be 13 or 14 years old , and the adult being in the .
and then i wonder , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something that doesn &apos;t it ?
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a child .
and one night i stayed too long and thought , my my my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judges has <unk> .
you should also want to do that .
and because it was too late , and i couldn &apos;t think really , i started working on a to a .
i had a <unk> , poor young boys as clients .
and i started to that bill . the title was , &quot; <unk> , &quot; to my arms , <unk> black <unk> as a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> .
in my astonishment , i explained that <unk> <unk> <unk> and to choose the police and <unk> .
there was a crazy line of that in this country , that &apos;s nothing more <unk> , that there is still an <unk> .
and the next morning , i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i dreamed of these crazy for me or actually written it .
and to my astonishment , i was just writing him , but also sent to the court .
a few months went over and i had forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i &apos;ve got to play in court , and i &apos;m a crazy case .
i got into the car and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
and finally , i went out of my car and went to the stairs .
when i was the the the the meal for the <unk> , black man , the job in court .
and he saw me , he came to me over and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
and then he put into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was force .
it touched a little bit deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribute to a community , to a sense of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you put these crazy <unk> ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i wrote these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office office .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry , that we talked about color , over the , overnight , overnight .
and from my <unk> , i saw the job and go down .
he saw it over through the window and could hear the whole thing .
he went on and down .
finally , this older black man came in with a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and sat straight behind me , almost on the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judges announced to a pause .
during the pause , a <unk> in , the it was upset that the job was in the <unk> jobs .
this <unk> ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the ? &quot;
the old black man stood on . he saw the <unk> , he saw me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to say to this young man , they don &apos;t give the destination out of the eyes .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe , but that it &apos;s the justice of justice .
that we &apos;re not being completely designed as long as we don &apos;t care about rights and <unk> .
that our entire survival is that the survival of each is connected .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity to connect with humanity , pity and justice .
and i &apos;d like to do that by you who just say that , just say , don &apos;t lose the target out of your eyes . don &apos;t give them on .
they have seen in this audience , that community , and you know , you &apos;ve seen a <unk> wish and hear something to do .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> in this spring , and it &apos;s actually a a effort , something that is <unk> , which is the politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , you will be in the next five years , one billion dollars for the death penalty billion dollars .
and yet , after <unk> percent of all <unk> doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
56 percent of all the <unk> are not in front of the <unk> .
there &apos;s the chance to do something .
this is a <unk> that is going to invest in more and safety and safety .
i think everywhere there are opportunities everywhere .
and over the last three decades , the <unk> has been immense down in america .
this is often often in a relationship with the elevated <unk> .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
well , actually , the number of the doesn &apos;t change the <unk> .
most of the <unk> of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really found in the class of <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
and so the dramatic lot of the dramatic figures come in prisoners .
we &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> by the rhetoric of punishment .
now , we have to &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , the people to get people to the <unk> , for a <unk> , for the theft of the theft , instead of that you force to give the people to the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who become victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think that our current current doesn &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , they really have a string string into the rope rope .
they &apos;re a inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you .
in his mind , his death is a increased <unk> .
two : famine , famine , 3 : <unk> <unk> .
four : psychotic <unk> . five : dangerous <unk> .
six : the social decline . 7 : 65 dead .
eight : <unk> . speakers .
there are a different speaker : <unk> . mass of mass destruction .
recession . <unk> . <unk> . syria . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so this is just a couple of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it would have the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative subjects because our minds are very <unk> attention to the very these subjects .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for it .
every second every day , our senses will catch a lot more information than our brains .
and because of us , is not more important than ours , the first stop for all the information is part of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our <unk> .
it <unk> <unk> all the information to the search for every <unk> of risk in our environment .
so , if we see the news , we prefer to look at negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it comes up , the demand is , &quot; is very true .
now , with all our digital devices , the week of all the negative news , all the negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that it &apos;s getting worse .
but perhaps this is not the case .
that &apos;s one of the reality .
maybe it &apos;s accelerating the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the past century , which is so strong that it will be possible for us to create a world of excess .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and <unk> -- we &apos;ve already already .
and as humans , we are much better to stop in trouble for the very long time , but they &apos;re going to get to stop .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can have to have the development .
in the last 100 years , the average lifespan is more than doubled that has tripled the world &apos;s <unk> .
child mortality has been a tenth .
and that is that the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and communication costs have a pair of glasses .
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re in a very peaceful time of life in life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> rate has gone from 25 percent of the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations continue to continue .
in fact , we have redefined poverty .
remember that a big proportion of americans who live under the poverty poverty , access to electricity , water , the <unk> , refrigerators , the cell phones , solar cell phones , solar cell , <unk> and cars .
the richest are the last century , the <unk> of the earth , would never have such a <unk> of art .
the foundation for many of these are technologies , and these grow <unk> .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that will be on information technology , on the curve of steam &apos;s <unk> , and all 12 to 24 months .
that costs the mobile phone in their pocket , and it &apos;s thousands of thousands faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is a last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how much you it is -- in good like , in good like , war or peace , recession , depression and <unk> .
that &apos;s the result of faster computers that make fast computers .
it &apos;s slowed to none of our big problems .
and , despite their logarithmic <unk> on the left it is up .
so the rate rate itself is speeding up .
and on this curve , on the back of a little law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all the .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that my friends in autodesk , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and sensors , robots , 3d scans that allow the personal production of the to our planet , synthetic biology , which is <unk> , <unk> and nutrition , digital medicine , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have the victory of <unk> supercomputer watson in &quot; jeopardy ? &quot;
that was great .
i spent the newspapers and looking for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s enemies . &quot;
risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence was going to each owner of each owner .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i &apos;m here at ted a new university called singularity university . &quot;
we bring our students all of these technologies to do particularly focus on how these are being used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , business , create products and services that can be a a decade in a decade that can affect the lives of people in a decade .
think about that , that a group of students can impact the lives of billions of people today .
thirty years ago , this was ridiculous .
today , we can refer to dozens of companies that have done exactly this .
if i think about a surplus , i mean , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about to create a life of possibilities .
it &apos;s about making a <unk> amount of abundance .
brevity is <unk> , and technology is a resources of <unk> force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy left .
he invited the king of <unk> dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> himself .
the king of <unk> was getting <unk> .
aluminum was too , of that time , most valuable metal on the planet , valuable as gold and <unk> .
this is the reason why the dome is made of aluminum .
even though aluminum <unk> takes a difference in the <unk> , it &apos;s not as a purely metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology was developed and made it was so cheap to use it with our <unk> .
and then let &apos;s put this analogy for the future .
we think about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re living on a planet that is filled more energy than we use a year .
16 <unk> energy , all <unk> <unk> minutes on the ground .
it &apos;s not about brevity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to do it to 50 percent of the oil cost to 50 percent of the oil &apos;s worth , <unk> rupees , compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar , in the last year , 50 percent .
and the last month that has published this with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the end of this decade in the end of the u.s. cars , compared to 15 cents per <unk> compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll also have water in a surplus also .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , as carl sagan , the <unk> in 1990 , when it was <unk> , back in the earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how was it ?
&quot; a <unk> blue . &quot;
because we live on a life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s a growing in the 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent of the , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting to 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation with dean kamen , one of the innovators of doing it , i &apos;d like to share with you , and he gave me the permission -- his <unk> , the <unk> , which is the <unk> , and that many of you may have heard about . it &apos;s the size of a <unk> in the <unk> .
it can generate thousands of clean clean drinking water a day -- whether it &apos;s water , contaminated water , <unk> , and all that for less than two cents a liter .
the director of coca-cola has just <unk> , a big <unk> of 100 units in the developing world .
and if everything is fine , and i &apos;m very confident , it will apply to coca-cola global in the world &apos;s global countries on the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that &apos;s there today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you know , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of the mobile phones in developing countries to end of 2013 .
just consider that a <unk> in the middle of kenya , a better <unk> in the middle of kenya , as president reagan was 25 years ago .
and if you look at google smartphone on google , they have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton in 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication , as nobody could ever have predicted .
and it &apos;s better , the things that you and i spent a couple of dollars on , and i &apos;ve spent a couple of dollars -- gps , <unk> and the photo , libraries and the <unk> , libraries , and the technology at medical diagnostics -- now literally literally <unk> and cheaper in their cell phone .
and the best part of what is in the realm of health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure with the <unk> that call &quot; $ 10 million <unk> <unk> x prize to announce . &quot;
we need teams around the world , all of these technologies in a cell phone that you can talk to the device that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s integrated with ai , you can test <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , the device has to provide a better diagnosis than a team of physicians .
imagine this device . in the middle of a country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the health care of health care .
if this device was a <unk> or <unk> , which is not known , it calls the <unk> and prevent a pandemic in front of their outbreak .
but now , the biggest force that will lead us to a world of excess .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are on the population .
we &apos;ve just been the <unk> .
and by the way , the biggest <unk> against a population population is a better upbringing and food in the world .
in 2010 , we had this just connected to two billion people online .
by 2020 , we get <unk> from two to five billion .
three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard before , will be in our conversation .
what do these people do ?
what are they going to consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of economic gridlock , i see one of the greatest economic history of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and they will be healthier by using the <unk> healthier , and they will trained into the <unk> , and by making a <unk> , and you can have the opportunity to make 3d printers and and so more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive , productive members of the vaccine ?
like it would be a sentence of new , never before the <unk> .
how about it , the oppressed , the oppressed , where they &apos;re , to be a voice to make attention to the and make change for the very first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i &apos;ve learned through the x prize , is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus , extraordinary things that can create the great business and governments only could do in the past .
i &apos;d like to finish with a story that has me really excited about .
there &apos;s a program that might have already know .
it &apos;s a game called solved .
it &apos;s developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where you can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will be .
the after its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so far , this is a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by university university .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that these days , the human pattern is better the same pattern , as the best supercomputer .
and when those people came and looked at who who &apos;s the best part of the world , it wasn &apos;t a <unk> , not a <unk> , , and a woman who was working in the day , and the best <unk> of the world was served and the best <unk> of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what i &apos;m doing is so , in our future today is the fact that we are more power than individuals to make us the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to an exponential technology .
we have a <unk> passion .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to to master the new challenges , and to do that , what needs to do .
we expect some of extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we have to do something against a <unk> component of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical medical and and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough in business , and i can give me a piece of my own <unk> <unk> to allow this to allow this .
but before i come to the word of my presentation , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the <unk> of the and moving us to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears soon and round statistics and to make this a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to try to find a number of a number of data that most of you &apos;ve heard about .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we talk about one 300 , if a bat tolls .
that means that the player is going to be <unk> for three .
that &apos;s called the ball into the <unk> , he &apos;s coming , he &apos;s not going to be caught up and then who &apos;s tries to throw the ball to first move , didn &apos;t get done in time and the moon was in security .
three of 10 .
you know how to call a <unk> <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
well , well , maybe a <unk> .
you know how to call a <unk> ?
that &apos;s one of the most likely to do four out of the rest of the rest .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> player who met over 400 times over 400 times .
let &apos;s back in my world of medicine , which i feel more comfortable and sometimes , i think , a little bit less than i &apos;ve talked about about it .
suppose you have a <unk> , and they &apos;re going to a <unk> , whose <unk> has 400 in terms of <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of working , it doesn &apos;t work ?
imagine they &apos;re living in a particular remote area , and they had a beloved people with <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> that to a <unk> , whose <unk> <unk> is at <unk> at 200 .
but , but , you know what ?
she &apos;s much better . it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on the .
and she &apos;s punching a <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;ll ask you a question .
what do you think about the <unk> of a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that one of the story is that one of the medicine knows what a good surgeon should be or doctor or <unk> .
what we do is that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to send out in the world to be in the claim .
never make a mistake , no one will be thinking about the details of how to be accomplished .
and that &apos;s the message that i would put in medical school .
i was a obsessive student student .
in the high school , a <unk> school said that brian <unk> would learn for a <unk> .
and that &apos;s how it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the sisters in the nick of general hospital , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
in my favorite , i learned the origins and the tail , every branch of a single artery which is the ascending aorta , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i actually knew the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the very time , i collected more and more .
and i was fine , i was <unk> <unk> .
and i left the study that i was , if i knew everything , and all knew , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible as possible , that i could be immune to the mistakes of mistakes .
and it worked for a time , until i met a little printer .
i was <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in toronto , and i was brought in a hospital &apos;s hospital in toronto .
at that point , i was the <unk> layer of the <unk> service .
and it was my assignment to looking at the <unk> <unk> advice to study the <unk> .
and feedback to my <unk> .
i saw a little printer and she was in <unk> .
and when i boil her to her , she made sounds like sounds .
and when i hear her chest with the <unk> <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides that she was under <unk> failure .
this is a state where the heart is failing , instead of heating all the blood , and it turns out a part of the blood in the lung and filling it gradually , so the <unk> came out .
and that was not a hard to diagnose <unk> diagnosis .
i put her and made me to the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine , which we call <unk> water , so that they <unk> the liquid .
and over a period of a and a half to two hours , she started to feel better .
i felt pretty well .
and there i did my first mistake ; i sent her home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent her home with my <unk> with my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take on them and did what a call in my <unk> , and he was <unk> to him so that he had a chance to have a own image .
and he knew it , he &apos;d been able to have to have an extra information to her .
maybe i did with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor doctor .
maybe i wanted to succeed and make it a responsibility that i was so like this , and so i would be able to deal with my patients without contact with it .
my second mistake was worse .
and by doing that , i sent them home , i was a little voice to me , &quot; the &quot; &apos; &quot; &apos; &quot; &apos; &quot; &apos; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good idea , do not do that . &quot;
in fact , i was very much to <unk> the nurse , i asked the a nurse , &quot; believe that &apos;s okay in order when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said , &quot; oh , i think it &apos;s going to go well . &quot;
i remember that being yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an ambulance and they were coming home .
and i went back to work .
the rest day , i had this dejected feel in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day i grabbed my stuff that was the hospital and went to the parking lot to the car to drive the car to the car than i did , i did not .
i went home by the <unk> of my way home .
and there was a other nurse , not the sister &apos;s seen the &quot; for a woman , but another three words to me and these three words are fear most of the most of the ones i know .
other medical medical fear is not as well , but the most <unk> is particularly particularly , because we just see the patient as well as well .
the three words , you know , remember ?
&quot; remember the patient who you &apos;d like to be like ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
so , &quot; she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after she came home , after i lowered her home , she collapsed , and the family called 911 , and they took them back to the <unk> with a blood pressure with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous <unk> .
she hardly breathe and was blue .
the <unk> is all the strands .
they gave her <unk> .
she closed them on the <unk> .
i was shocked and to the inner <unk> .
and i went through this rollercoaster because they went to the <unk> <unk> , and i hoped that they would recover .
and after two , three days realized that she would never dreamed back .
she had not been killed by a <unk> .
their family around .
and over the course of eight or nine days , they made it on the <unk> .
they &apos;d go to <unk> them -- wife &apos;s a printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you never forget the names of the hearing rights .
and that was the first time i was told this .
the next few weeks , i would claims , and i was told the most unhealthy shame that exist in our medical culture -- i felt alone , not the kind of good good good , you feel like , not the kind of good good good , you feel like , because you don &apos;t talk to the people about it .
you all know the healthy shame , if you &apos;re going to have a secret to the best friend &apos;s best , and you get it and the best friend and the best friend gets to the very bad , and you &apos;re <unk> that you will never make a mistake like this .
if you don &apos;t make it and mistakes the mistakes .
that &apos;s the kind of <unk> shame .
the <unk> kind of <unk> that i &apos;m talking about is the one of the <unk> of the .
it &apos;s the one who says that &apos;s not what you did is bad , but that &apos;s what you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t in the reason of my <unk> , he was very dear .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure that he was <unk> <unk> and sure i would not sued .
but i asked these questions .
why did i didn &apos;t ask the <unk> ? why do i do it ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why am i went to medicine ?
but it &apos;s also , it &apos;s safe .
i started to feel better .
and then on a day day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun breaks down and i said maybe maybe i can feel better .
and i was with me , that if i had to come through my efforts to perfection and never come into a mistake that the voice could be <unk> .
and she did .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened .
two years later , i had service in the <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital in the north of toronto , and i was a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of going on , and i &apos;m in a hurry .
he was always showing up here .
i looked into the <unk> and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and he sent him .
and when he went out of the door , he showed up on his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> and my <unk> asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out that he was a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google google , but it &apos;s not infection in the air , but it &apos;s causing the <unk> to the <unk> .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t died .
he got <unk> <unk> , and it recovered .
and i went back through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , and it felt <unk> , and went back to the work until again and again and again .
in a <unk> , i have two <unk> a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of thing that , especially if you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that had only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i sent them to home and there was no imperfections in their treatment .
i thought he had a <unk> .
i <unk> the <unk> of the kidneys , and when it was without a <unk> , my colleague , my colleague at the <unk> of the patient &apos;s <unk> on the lower world , and called the <unk> .
the other had a lot of diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> him and asked my colleagues to see him .
and that &apos;s what he did and as he was a <unk> in the right where the right , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> , and it was good .
both of the cases , i <unk> myself on .
and i would be happy to say that my worst mistake was only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but it &apos;s bullshit .
some of my <unk> happened in the last five years .
by himself , uncomfortable with us .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close with my mistakes and i can leave you and talk about it , if i can &apos;t get the silent voice that i can &apos;t find what can i share with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes , so they don &apos;t make the same thing ?
if i &apos;d like to do in a room like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you heard the last time of someone who talked about <unk> about <unk> &apos;s talking about <unk> ?
oh yeah , they go to a cocktail party and you know , you know , you hear about any doctor , but you don &apos;t get somebody to talk about their mistakes .
if i had a room full of colleagues , and to start to tell you and to start telling you what i just told you , i wouldn &apos;t reach the end of the second story before it would get a joke , <unk> , you &apos;d come to change the topic and you &apos;d get the rest .
and actually , if i had to my colleagues that a <unk> in my hospital had lost someone that had lost a wrong leg , then you believe me , i had trouble to see the problems in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system in which we live in .
it &apos;s totally counterintuitive from mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in the there are two basic positions -- those who are making mistakes and those who are not doing , those who are <unk> , and the without bad results , and the with bad results , and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response to as antibodies that attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we are the ones that make mistakes in the medicine that we have a safe system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of medical <unk> and journalism , i have a personal medical study across medical failures and wrong treatments , and i was looking for for the toronto of my my first article , which i was writing for the toronto star , black art .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system where a single day in which one of 10 <unk> is either wrong or wrong in the middle of the world , and and more and more devastation and devastation .
in that state , for example , about 80,000 canadians were dying of <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine , the number of 100,000 .
they are very strong <unk> , because we don &apos;t just look at the problem as well as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> in the medical system , the medical knowledge is going to be around two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake that we can take a perfect <unk> player for a patient with chest chest .
and then i take the same patient with <unk> , and you put it and <unk> and <unk> , and you get a slightly <unk> breath and a sudden , the story of <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same over .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not always doing things .
and my patients are no cars ; they don &apos;t always tell their symptoms in the same way .
all these are these errors are unavoidable .
so , if you take the system that way i &apos;ve been taught , and all the <unk> <unk> edited out , then no longer one left .
and you know the <unk> of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black art , &quot; i was my worst mistake &quot; and to the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; and then i &apos;ll show the microphone with the microphone . &quot;
and then your pupils can extend their pupils , they &apos;ve come down , and you look down and swallow it hard , and begin to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what they need is an environment which they &apos;re in .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new <unk> physician is a human , knows his humanity , she &apos;s not proud of making mistakes , but it allows all to learn anything from you to learn it .
they share their experiences with others .
they supported when others are talking to their mistakes .
and they &apos;re not in the <unk> of their mistakes , not to <unk> , but in a loving , , , , also , supportive ways that all benefit from it .
and it &apos;s in a medical culture that recognizes that people put the system with life and when it &apos;s so , then people make mistakes in time .
that &apos;s how the system evolved to make a difference which makes it easier to find mistakes that consumers are inevitable and and it also enabled us to do things that are going to be rewarded and for people like me who are going to be rewarded and for people who are going to be rewarded for the <unk> of those rewards .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m the new being successful .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to learn from it to try to go to others .
i don &apos;t know what they hold me , but i can live .
so let me close with three of my own words , i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this one in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories about the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , i guess he was <unk> .
you might think he hunt <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s actually collected fish .
he described one of them as a very , &quot; usually .
it was a <unk> .
until the 1980s , it was fish in a big scale .
now he &apos;s now in the red list .
this story , we &apos;ve heard many times of the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very very special .
and yet , we still get the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the <unk> is still describe as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to a different concept , the <unk> of light .
because i &apos;ve experienced it when i studied a lagoon in <unk> .
i went to because i grew up in europe and i was going to work in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad <unk> and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t that .
it was my first <unk> .
as you see , the lagoon was <unk> and some of the mangroves .
there were <unk> 20 centimeters , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen were were good at all of them and made in ghana levels of themselves .
when i returned to there , when i returned to the fish , the fish has shrunk to half of its size .
after adults , they reduced five inches .
they were genetically modified .
there were still fish .
the people were still happy .
and the fish also had the happiness , even there .
so it &apos;s changed , and yet it changed everything .
my third little story tells me from my favorite <unk> in southeast asia .
in the 1970s , the beginning of the 60s -- <unk> europe , many <unk> .
<unk> , countries , the <unk> of the fish , the industrial fishing was that pretty ugly ship called the <unk> fourth .
i was driving on it and we did it all the southern <unk> and in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know that it was the bottom of the sea .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble of these were the <unk> , were <unk> .
so basically , the ocean was the <unk> , and then it &apos;s got <unk> .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you &apos;re a survey , and then you get the working in the commercial fishing .
the reason is it is changing . it &apos;s in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals will piss .
that &apos;s a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them off because they were dead .
and once we started a living .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> .
and then they wanted to kill them because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of these filaments of these were collected every time of dolphins , they can put together , if they drive in areas where they &apos;re never been fish in .
but it &apos;s not documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we can fit our <unk> to the new level , and we don &apos;t make us in memory , which was there .
if you put it up , this is what happens .
on the y-axis are a few good things : biodiversity , the number of the <unk> , the green of their country , the <unk> .
time it changes . it changes because for people are all of them .
every generation of the images that you are looking at the beginning of their conscious life as the standard and everything is going to derive everything .
the difference is what &apos;s being a loss .
but you can &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can give a sequence of change .
and the end , they just want to get the <unk> remains remains .
right now , that &apos;s now , is a very <unk> .
we want to get things that have gone , or things that are not more like they were .
now , you might think that the problem was , which is sure when they lived in <unk> societies , animals , and they were killing animals and just realized for a few generations of what they did .
because obviously , an animal is being very often , very often , before it was <unk> .
so you don &apos;t have a frequent animal species .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not as a lot of loss .
and with the time we focus on the large animals and the sea , the big fish are the big fish .
they &apos;re going to be rarer because we &apos;re catching them .
there &apos;s little fish left there , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , we told that it was really different .
they will tell it because the evidence that they &apos;re in a previous form of weather , are not like that they would like to be warning the evidence .
and for example , there &apos;s an anecdote that the report of a <unk> project who observed in this area , which is a great <unk> , or not normally <unk> , because it &apos;s not scientific &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in skilled societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
that shows the tremendously big role that can play a marine marine marine marine marine marine marine .
because by marine marine , we actually put the past back .
we &apos;re thinking about the past people who can &apos;t understand the , because the <unk> has changed and very low .
so the people who see a marine marine marine marine marine , and the benefit that enables it to have to reset their <unk> .
what about the people who don &apos;t get that because they don &apos;t have access to -- the people in the middle west ?
so here , i think , the art and the film might fill the gap and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago there was <unk> , 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> may be you to be familiar with &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar &quot; , &quot; if you think of why the people are being touched by being so being so being so being so touching the <unk> of the world ?
because it &apos;s a little bit of <unk> that &apos;s lost in a way .
so , so , so , so , my one , the only one i &apos;m going to be giving is , you &apos;re standing with the avatar &apos;s avatar .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist , you had to be , if you owned a typewriter , which is the government .
they also <unk> a sheet with a <unk> of a typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could track them back into where a text came from .
and they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could try to figure out the father of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand the west , as someone could do anything like anything , and how much the the speech would be cut on the speech of speech .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
but if you &apos;re in 2011 , a new <unk> of the leading <unk> and print , and print , and then , there &apos;s the light yellow <unk> on each page , in a pattern that is clear to you and her printer .
that &apos;s what happens happening .
and it seems to be a <unk> of <unk> .
and that was an example of what we own our own governments are our technology against us , they use .
and that &apos;s one of the three medals of the existing <unk> of the existing .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening on the world : we can split the attacks into categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> in ukraine .
and the very easy thing to understand the <unk> are very easy .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several cases of <unk> , <unk> <unk> that made their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
there &apos;s a little bit of the watt .
<unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
these people are coming online , but they &apos;ve managed to put it illegal for for example , to put money from our <unk> to steal money , and we &apos;re doing our <unk> , and we &apos;ve got our <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> that we &apos;ve collected over a infected computers online .
the u.s. intelligence agency did two months ago , and swiss <unk> account a , and on this ledger , and this ledger <unk> million dollars that was frozen .
mr. jain himself is a free foot , which is not unknown .
and i &apos;d argue that it is more likely to be victims of a <unk> , as an <unk> in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will be even worse .
in the future , most crimes online .
the second second is that we can now see , are not by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- the the way , you know , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are over the last 12 months and are to one of the <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so that &apos;s the three <unk> : criminals that are paying for money because of the anonymous who are giving them to the resistance , but the last group of nations , nations , governments who lead the attacks .
there are us , like the <unk> .
it turns out what happens when governments are going to attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or it was it .
in the last fall , it had been <unk> , because <unk> was hacked .
somebody had been hacked and had hacked into a very thorough .
and last week in a meeting , dutch <unk> , i posed a senior student who could be able to do it for possible that because of the <unk> people had died of the <unk> .
and his answer was &quot; yes .
now , how are people dying in a tiny hacks of these hacks hacks ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell to <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate , you need to have a website with a website with a <unk> , for example .
now we all use or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but they &apos;re particularly widely prevalent in the <unk> states like iran , where are <unk> by <unk> , because they know that the local government cannot not be in their conversation .
but , but if you &apos;re in a foreign
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> aims .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of <unk> .
what does it happen with the arab spring and the things that are happening in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the spanish in april 2011 , the headquarters of egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in this records , a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder folder , the <unk> of a local company , the egyptian government had sold a few programs that they sold -- in very large framework -- any communication of the egyptian citizens can capture .
they had sold this program for <unk> euro to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is exactly here .
so western governments are providing governments to deliver governments to do with their own citizens .
but western governments are helping themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , called the so-called <unk> , which was a <unk> who was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you get in a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s almost a lot of the phone , it &apos;s <unk> .
but today we are far beyond .
you tap your internet connection .
they use tools like the <unk> to <unk> their computer with a <unk> <unk> , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , to collect their <unk> .
so , if we keep thinking about these things , the obvious answer to the people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t even me , because i &apos;m a citizen citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument makes no sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not to debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and while we now , in 2011 , our governments may be trust , but every is right , we &apos;re going to be coming out of forever .
and we trust , we trust ourselves to any future government , a government that we might have been in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to have to engage with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made and <unk> <unk> and <unk> a simple idea : <unk> <unk> , with some <unk> that fit together .
<unk> were very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us into the able to build things that were larger than we , buildings , bridges , one stone after the other .
basically , the <unk> was turned to a building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego , lego .
it was called &quot; automatically rock . &quot;
and within a few years , lego , lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones , or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful bridges or beautiful building .
lego made it for all possible .
so lego has essentially the <unk> of the building block the world , and it took a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year , the bell labs , the next building of the building building .
the transistor was a small <unk> of <unk> that was a little <unk> of <unk> that would be a world of a static , <unk> building building in a world of everything that was interactive .
like the <unk> , we allow us to build much greater , more complex diagnostic cycle , one stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building of building building is reserved for experts and therefore i decided to change that .
eight years ago i was at mit media lab , and i started to explore this idea how to make the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing is that they connect with magnets together .
so they can &apos;t put them wrong .
the stones are <unk> .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange .
so everything you have to do is a blue and a green one , and they can build a very fast <unk> of <unk> .
they put a green one green into a green , and you can make light .
they can insert a wall between them and they built a little <unk> .
take the switch out to a <unk> , which is , bring it into a <unk> , and they made a little <unk> .
add this <unk> for an extra effect , and they made a <unk> .
i will stop that .
and the simple thing about the simple play is actually quite powerful .
instead of being able to code , or <unk> , to <unk> with a <unk> , allowing you to code with you with simple intuitive gestures .
so , to slow down the cattle or slow , it just turn it to this button and it makes the momentum faster faster or slow down .
the idea behind the is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to put every single interaction in this world into a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- all should be available .
we &apos;ve got <unk> to children and they play with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is , how they start to have the electronics that surrounds them in the everyday life , and they don &apos;t learn to school .
like a <unk> <unk> , or why the doors to the <unk> , or like an ipod can respond to a touch .
we also brought to <unk> <unk> .
so we had a designer designer with no experience in electronic things that started to play with <unk> as a material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago we did <unk> , and gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> of play-doh that &apos;s afraid of darkness .
for this <unk> , , a more material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to do this material for all available .
so , open open source .
you can go to the website , all the <unk> cell scan and make it .
we want to be the world of the creators , the inventor , the <unk> , because the world we live in , we &apos;ve heard this interactive world , we &apos;ve heard us .
so , pull it up and start to invent them .
thank you .
