think about it -- because there are other people like bill gates who said , &quot; man , you have a real computer . &quot;
latin , it &apos;s also quite rare . let &apos;s see some languages .
and guess what ? we won it .
we have a case for the case , not to integrate any additional <unk> in order to keep the prices down the bottom .

and that one thing i showed you before , of course , was a very complex .
it &apos;s going to win or lose in that moment .
the emotional bond between this object and you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s happening before you think about it .
i don &apos;t think we have to make it a choice .
it &apos;s also a thought we &apos;ve forgotten .

and dengue fever has spread in <unk> .
two days ago , or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember exactly , i &apos;ve read the first <unk> <unk> , about 52 beats cases , with about 400 <unk> cases .
we need something that was really <unk> , so he &apos;s not going to spread the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males meets females , a lot of them .
so , <unk> are not our biggest problem .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; why here ? &quot;
and most of the time i remove me not even though i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
look at the data on the data .
now , our mobile phones can now be construct a story of our <unk> .
bill <unk> : your health depends on where they live .
that &apos;s my grandfather .
it &apos;s because of the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
as the beginning , the plants , the plants , <unk> out of water .
here &apos;s a remarkable article from a <unk> of &quot; nature , &quot; the discussion that the discussion about the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of them just go .
and instead of 100 percent , we &apos;re going to take one of 25 percent .
we have a functioning technology and one that is using a <unk> <unk> , which is going to be a few of the <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re using the world &apos;s fourth world .
and he was a called <unk> , he was looking at all the <unk> and mutations to find rules and laws , rather than looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see that the single levels , repeat , but they &apos;re going to be without being <unk> .
as an architect , i think of relationships with the parts and all the , but in terms of product product , it &apos;s always going to do more a business for business .
we were looking at the level of the building of the building , where we could build the five separate towers , but they should all the <unk> to the 60 floor to a single <unk> mass .
let &apos;s come back , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape is actually actually look after <unk> as a rainforest .
the difference is particularly in <unk> in desert , or maybe <unk> in <unk> , whatever they want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that were illegal to be thrown by the air .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and the phosphorus in the world , just by fertilizers that are the huge problems of water quality ; in lakes , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important <unk> for <unk> .
but we can , and there &apos;s a opportunities for it .
it &apos;s the biggest <unk> on the <unk> .
to work together .
so , what is that system d ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole system network is to be able to control .
we &apos;re interacting with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological amplifier to reinforce these <unk> .
so this is what it looks like .
here we <unk> , or cut the nerve , from the <unk> , by small parts of the <unk> and then we had other pristine pristine that gave us our <unk> signal -- two other , who gave us our hand -- and the signal gave us our hand .
ak : it works well .
but i can &apos;t put electrode into a stick and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal to have to have to have to have more targets .
and this is jesse and he presses a <unk> .
so thank you .
sub-saharan africa has largely , because there are 22 million people with hiv , that are estimated 70 percent of 30 million people who are infected .
governments faced , effective <unk> to ethical <unk> in ethical aspects that are being in the different developing world . and <unk> are established , the government and the <unk> of the study .
the fundamental problems that we are faced with is a to <unk> consumption and too many people .
so they all fulfill the criteria that they would usually like .
so you can see that electricity , which is to be north -- the <unk> in this case -- the <unk> in the galapagos , and this <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> that starts to go up in the galapagos .
we also know that not only be a threat to be under the same , but just as penguins and other <unk> .
i &apos;d like to show you that penguins are going to be pulled in <unk> .
turbo has <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> , and he &apos;s in and he comes in here .
and then there &apos;s another , that &apos;s very comfortable with <unk> .
well , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we &apos;re not solved , our fundamental political geography .
the two parts is a very long frontier .
again , like mongolia , china doesn &apos;t have russia . it &apos;s <unk> it .
for <unk> countries , its <unk> , that <unk> and cambodia were able to sell and cambodia , and they were cheaper to china .
what i want to introduce you here , i call a day day in a day .
so , these two <unk> the <unk> , a bow of <unk> and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with the west bank .
a lot of them .
so what comes next ? how does the future of european union ?
53 countries , and far , most of the suspects are straight lines on the map .
this dream is the time .
is it bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like this .
okay .
and that hormone semen is that growth .
so how can a hormone eventually eventually , the speed of aging ?
we think that insulin and igf-1 are , who are active in the circumstances of the circumstances of the things -- in good times -- if food is enough , and not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo genes have an impact on the lifespan of people .
and basically , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process of which i &apos;ve talked about what in the brain quickly , a different normal <unk> of , like a bird , like a bird that can live much longer .
you will never see any kind of display , because nike wants to buy your shoes .
they all show heroes , the <unk> .
it &apos;s like trying to walk against a <unk> .
this is what that view is that many <unk> of <unk> are <unk> how prozac are essentially changing the chemistries of the brain as if in fact , the brain of the container of a chemical soup would be .
and my <unk> colleague , seymour <unk> believes that .
and by the <unk> , we found that a parties had a lot longer to take the <unk> back , and when we were the genes that played in this mutation , we could find a <unk> of <unk> .
this is a question for a long time in people , but in the way , we can actually test it .
so , you &apos;re going to find us in the dark , by us , and they smell us .
just so you can see it , that &apos;s the cheese .
people actually told me that they &apos;re like to be bitten by mosquitos .
in <unk> .
and every time , i felt the <unk> look at the eyes of the eyes of the eyes of the .
and as <unk> , is fat one of the best sources for adult stem cells .
while we speak , they &apos;re about <unk> clinical trials to <unk> stem cells for <unk> cells .
we are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world , not only in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens if what does not happen ?
but here &apos;s what &apos;s really going on .
and i can &apos;t tell you about it , because i stopped the title of headline .
<unk> <unk> : what about the marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems to be able to make these receivers , with this is that we &apos;re encoded in dna .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s going to be it it it &apos;s going to be it it , it &apos;s going to take a single , and it doesn &apos;t really get a single way there the fly between two pieces of trapped .
for a intelligent creatures like our fly , it &apos;s not that rule not be set in stone , but it changes as the animal learns by experience .
through many of these experiments , we were able to put the identity of the critic &apos;s the <unk> of 12 cells .
there are some ideas in the <unk> and artificial intelligence , how to do it , but we still have a single example of how intelligent behavior from the physical interaction of living matter .
here &apos;s actually , of course , or actually a <unk> of mine .
ed : all right . tb : okay . a little bit like you , you &apos;re going to go to the center .
i know , i know , hospitals for young people can be a very dangerous place .
here is a picture of my legacy of mine .
one of the one i &apos;m going to tell you , this kind of <unk> that is all about their genomes , the <unk> pathway that we &apos;re in in our lifetime in health care .
they don &apos;t stick or or glue or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc <unk> built the <unk> <unk> .
what would happen if you climb on the bottom of the pad , and it would come up and you could go and leave the leaf ? &quot;
and so , it &apos;s like , and he does this .
of course , completely different than you would see it in a <unk> .
we will look at the rising sea level .
and i would say , the people who are working in the oceans and the goals think about the goals , we should be much lower .
that &apos;s the ship that i was the last three months in antarctica .
if that ice ice ice ice ice goes down to six meters .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news is the the galapagos in the galapagos islands .
you have the water in the water .
but then you see the <unk> in black in black .
we &apos;ve done very interesting ways that growth growth in the atmosphere of years , we &apos;ve done it just with <unk> , but in this case , we go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein asked : to figure how gravity works .
and einstein has already been room and time , warps and curves to describe gravity .
but deep in the fabric of the room , so the idea could give it more dimensions than we see there .
and as just like the strings of a cello , can vibrate out of the threads also vibrating into different patterns .
not .
is this just a interesting mathematical construction which may be able to explain some of the <unk> <unk> properties of the world , or can we actually detect this extra dimensions in actually show ?
so we have two panels here with colored dots .
well , can see the predator , what is it to attack you ?
and what &apos;s true for sensory information is true to all of information .
and we &apos;re looking at about 30 seconds , which is a pretty much a long talk in a 18 minutes .
why ? because if the dark in this shadow is actually , and the same amount of light on its eye would reflect on its eye , like the dark layer of the shadow , they &apos;d have to reflect more -- just according to the act of physics .
how do you know that ?
and she comes into the beehive , there &apos;s a empty <unk> and hands -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . awesome , right ?
do you ? yes ?
there &apos;s no right right right or wrong .
in new york , in new york .
we also have a species of the storyteller .
now some things : understanding of security , the risks , the risks , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks we &apos;re faced with .
think about cancer , avian flu , swine , sars .
there was no new lesson , but less fear .
and there are another cognitive distortion : i call it <unk> by trying to accept the data that disagree with our <unk> and data to <unk> the <unk> of our <unk> .
i know a different group , to determine if my airplane was safe to fly with this .
this is the people .
and he was found in the near , in stanford .
they had good instruction with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions about whether it &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took anybody to get them to get them or to save me as a volunteer , but i found that nobody did something .
we opened the first stage 2009 .
robert <unk> : a park in the sky .
and groups were very often known to terrorists . &quot;
they need a <unk> process , which is the core of that very complicated society with solving with solving with solving .
it &apos;s about that we probably have to see the history of the arab world in the world &apos;s history : a <unk> of <unk> .
the paradox of this is that &apos;s been so successful , and that &apos;s one key thing .
in a time , the ngos called the <unk> of the slogans , not just on the streets -- but they did them in negotiations , to part because they were the victims of these weapons .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think , &quot; <unk> &quot; is something good .
so this was a very smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy to work on a new <unk> .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange of the strange man ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the the the sun comes out , the sun comes out , they come right to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to admit that i &apos;m a little nervous because i &apos;m going to tell you a couple radical things about how we should think about cancer , which is a lot of people who are doing a lot more than i do .
the part of the genome we can read is the list of ingredients .
it &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics in genetics , which is just the genetic similarity .
and i like , &quot; okay . so at least this guy is fine . &quot;
so , we basically measure every <unk> as a whole .
if you have malaria , we give them <unk> , or some of the <unk> .
where we really have to get the process that is just going to be in the level of the <unk> activity on the level of the time of the body doesn &apos;t healed as how he normally do it ?
danny hillis : cancer is understanding by proteomics
they all are members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give these people .
because at stage three , most of us are .
that &apos;s their lobby .
there was no plan . never tried to do anything like this .
in fact , martin luther king king &apos;s owned by stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting in this chair here and do nothing . &quot;
and suddenly they got the <unk> out , and tried to figure out , &quot; how to ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
automatically <unk> , we &apos;re automatically the little bits of plastic up .
these <unk> or <unk> <unk> , designed to take so much to the ground for the ground , to the ground , they &apos;re not as a permanent building .
they <unk> the stability and safety that can offer the lap of an uncle , is to compare them with the <unk> &apos;s perpetual <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the <unk> form of <unk> gratification .
i can &apos;t really explain it , and he doesn &apos;t really explain .
stories like this , signs like this , are practical aid in a world that yearns for dreams to bring compassion to the <unk> of suffering that might be otherwise <unk> .
gandhi was also a <unk> person .
and the first day , our predecessor , our <unk> , and taught us our narrative that we had to put a place for the rest of the summer to make the difference .
that &apos;s one of two or three of their known .
here are some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t be part of a group without instinctively , the other people &apos;s opinion of imitating .
so that &apos;s the world we live in today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather &apos;s my grandfather &apos;s own way .
okay , number two : go in the wild .
and imagine this , you &apos;re going to take a inner picture , i was born in a very small village in mexico , unfortunately , very <unk> , and my parents had no higher education .
and so we think that through all the changes , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to have is incredible opportunities today .
it &apos;s a initiative that is on simple , <unk> , and <unk> solutions .
we now send 30 technologists now in 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people in the pursuit of the to learn what this particular market needs and demands .
and my father came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember , every generation of it has to do better than the previous one .
i know a lot of people who are very smart and saying , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started in 1980 with a different family .
don &apos;t you believe that we have the responsibility to take the tackle seriously ? &quot;
i still drive the same four years of ford as before .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s praying .
if you believe it or not , doesn &apos;t make any difference for me .
so he said , &quot; what do you think in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s that in your hand ? &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball represents your identity , which is what they &apos;re .
when my kids were small , i was always sitting in her room , sat down to her bed , and i looked at my kids in sleeping .
it &apos;s less than i had <unk> -- i <unk> with three to 10 million -- but still it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we then have 100 laptops , each one with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village of all of sudden <unk> .
right , the famous chinese characters for <unk> .
and they answer the question : how does it feel like to realize that you &apos;re going to be ?
we &apos;re learning that really bad lesson .
think of a moment of how it is , to feel right .
and unlike all other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i write this incredibly naive book on a topic that everybody hate , for a audience that would never be giving .
now , of course , of course , not just <unk> <unk> wheat , but the mountains of them .
1986 , they came from vietnam to america .
the answer was <unk> , &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our <unk> sank up a third of the <unk> in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and bhutan that don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy in the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually so that we &apos;re often going to hunt , often , as though , the happiness we have to to capture , a thing , or maybe some of things we need to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- this is the simplicity .
what we need to learn as leaders is that we can impact the <unk> of production by using the right conditions so that our employees can live their calling .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
under the deck , you &apos;re going to go you , but the eyes are moving in unison with the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m silent . &quot;
amy , come to go up ?
the method : what did you do ? what do you do , what did you see ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should be giving a voice and enable them to express that , and so that &apos;s what amy is to the last word in this short story .
poor people have not choice .
we were in the &apos; 70s .
and to get there , we have to realize that the principle of the <unk> doesn &apos;t just the kind of incentives that we talked about , but also our society .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody who already asked you , &quot; yes , great things up -- but how do i get there ?
i was a professor at the <unk> davis and got a lot of attention to this , and that would allow me to finance the launch of the program .
we &apos;ve got eight engines in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall apart , and they end up here .
i mean , people are doing , if there &apos;s safe phones .
you have a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> cell phone .
and for those who can &apos;t read it , it says , &quot; it seems like it &apos;s a kind of <unk> technology . &quot;
green or natural <unk> , where not a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the <unk> poisons in our bodies .
first , a <unk> , filled with <unk> , which is called &quot; <unk> death . &quot;
and i was going to tell months later who he was really .
i search for a cure .
i say , &quot; keep it alive , if you can . &quot;
even with this <unk> paper in our hands , we &apos;re redefining the hope again .
it &apos;s a feature .
he suddenly knows he &apos;s defeated .
to give you to allow you to make it back to the driver &apos;s seat .
we <unk> the field , we we started to bring it , we were eating people in , we <unk> the buildings , the <unk> , and we helped the first <unk> of the <unk> , and the search and rescue .
if i do that , i don &apos;t lose the kind of the animal that &apos;s kind of the things that i could write about this .
you &apos;re withheld from the public opinion .
it &apos;s not particularly good .
and that &apos;s a democracy .
here &apos;s the question : which land is going to do better , china or india ?
because the indian man has a advantage of two years of the indian woman .
what political change is , they &apos;ve introduced a <unk> .
china , so i think , has a couple of outstanding , <unk> foundations -- particularly about social capital , public health , a sense of equality that &apos;s not in india .
it was a place where people with <unk> and with various <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
and now , you have the problem that they spent all the money to afford to do with these advanced electronics in these countries , and now everything is <unk> .
a slightly chaotic environment , where probably a lot of ideas came to , where people were more new , interesting , interesting , <unk> controversies -- people different backgrounds .
about a decade ago , a wonderful <unk> called howard <unk> , and i read this darwin &apos;s notebook from this period .
they <unk> himself with their colleagues , but everyone said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it was to do it .
is the other way to the other way ?
in the 1970s , this was one percent , 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
many of these political factors can be mined roughly , in the category of capitalism , &quot; political transitions that are linked to a group of good interconnected , but actually don &apos;t really get good for the rest of us .
while you can see quite easily , how globalization and technological revolution is that the global regime of money , is it much harder to evaluate it all .
and so , they are unprecedented amounts of time and resources to train their children .
we &apos;ve created the modern <unk> .
that &apos;s his little hand .
we &apos;re going to die of that .
that was a huge disappointed for us , because we believed in a new development .
i believe in places like oregon , where you can take a look at a claim and a <unk> <unk> dose , only half a half of people ever have done it .
so long , long , you &apos;re coming to canada .
but i heard about cancer as most of the most <unk> disease of our time , how did that kind of the good and bad ?
and some articles left even as far to say that <unk> is resistant to cancer , and beyond that , not only about cancer , but reversing metastases , to skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that , that these <unk> tumors were in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual <unk> -- what <unk> is that skeletal muscle is capable capable capable capable of control angiogenesis , which is that tumors in the order of the tumors .
it &apos;s a very far <unk> idea , but i really believe that that &apos;s possible .
after that , my translator came me .
she was the girl who was in the breaks the other for her team .
and the same thing i wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia that had a 11 eve son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from korea , and he found families for her .
they have a lot of time on the dictionary .
so i open the windows , look out , and see how burned burned from the side of the hotels . the hotel burning .
so we went into the bath , we took <unk> , and they assumed our faces and the children .
until the adoption is through , a year ! what &apos;s going to do this long ?
that &apos;s their <unk> .
this is sydney , who &apos;s three years old , who &apos;s three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there are small planets , there &apos;s bigger planets , there &apos;s big planets , ok .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomena , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and that deeper <unk> , the underlying point is that the science is that the life is how we know it to define new .
okay , let &apos;s say , this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , all right here .
thank you very much .
see : while uganda <unk> and zimbabwe , russia , russia , russia .
they find the highest hiv in the world in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , here , the same rate as in the united states .
so , look at here kenya .
it might be something else is something that is more than the transmission .
we know that about <unk> billion people have ever lived .
it wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
and the result is even a greater divergence in a shorter time than it was in germany .
it &apos;s just the same thing with institutions .
they have to give me to eat . &quot;
he was wrong .
well , i want to end up with three questions about the future billion , just in 2016 , when the united states will lose their place as number one of china .
no , we &apos;ll probably agree with each of the giant <unk> that we put together , notwithstanding the evidence that we &apos;ve lost our ethic ethic and the other parts of our historical .
niall , thank you .
there are many kinds of spider spider silks .
spider spider spider spider is almost entirely <unk> .
the fibers that can make a single spider , are pretty diverse .
and also , <unk> have a huge potential for its capacity to the <unk> .
what i want to pay attention is not the <unk> , as lovely as you might be , but on the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more pictures . there &apos;s more photographers .
that sounds <unk> in our ears , but what &apos;s happened is that 80 percent of the <unk> have contributed a lot .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem with a problem is that the first goal of the institution is immediately changing the way to itself .
the inventor doesn &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states who try to find out if if bloggers <unk> or not .
it was made by using their <unk> , the use of the many of these tools , analyzed , no doubt the intelligence agencies the world today the <unk> of the world for attacks in the last week .
you have <unk> , which is probably a part of the <unk> part of the bread or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because it &apos;s made of fibers .
everything is in its place . first level .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s take the different steps back , under the <unk> of the possible of a deeper plane -- my search for the answer to the question , &quot; what is so especially in bread ? &quot;
that &apos;s transforming , two different things .
and if they &apos;re shaped , they go back to the further to prove that they &apos;re in life and character .
if you do this bread , you can use any kind of spent a lot of a beer .
it will be a kind of <unk> while we &apos;re working through this talk .
it &apos;s very , very long , these scores , and i work on a piece , and i work on a piece , that &apos;s a little bit of my life , and that &apos;s a big part of my life , and i salute myself the hair .
it &apos;s demonstrated by brian <unk> , which is an extraordinary artist .
that &apos;s a little excerpt of the song .
what we did -- betty <unk> , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two bowls of eating : a bowl with a <unk> broccoli , and a dish with <unk> <unk> .
i mean , the end of the time , if we look at the baby face of the , they appear to us quite useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies of each other species .
the <unk> is bringing them to make the hypothesis .
now , there are two things that are really interesting about it .
boy : so .
our consciousness is going to be extremely bright and vivid , and everything is going dark .
&quot; babies and young children are like the r and the human species , &quot; the <unk> says , <unk> <unk> . their research , like babies in playing diagnostic information , and use diagnostic information and make decisions .
if i could borrow for you to just give you a little demonstration , but it &apos;s actually pretty trivial .
and then you repeatedly , and over again , the <unk> comes out , and then it &apos;s going to be the figure , like me , walk straight .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do that far .
here &apos;s a couple of simple scenes like it comes to .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we did it yet .
some studio are already using our software to do this , and we &apos;re going to see a few of our <unk> in a few large <unk> of <unk> .
we thought he just would just hold the balance .
here you learn to go to the <unk> -- like most of you hope to know .
but i have to say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i &apos;m convinced that art and creativity , are critical to develop empathy empathy .
if you &apos;re the lonely , they write a new york times , then they get hundreds of emails . most of what i &apos;ve reached today is covered by frustration .
some stories are just creative , and yet it gets that .
it <unk> . nobody ever bought it .
there &apos;s a limit that we don &apos;t want to cross . what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new blank document in word -- that might be on !
but i think there are actually two <unk> .
the other products were given by microsoft with an open standard , instead of <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> , if somebody &apos;s a <unk> , i write a <unk> -- what happens every day -- i say , &quot; relieve me . &quot;
but when i was looking at the most <unk> technologies , nanotechnology , and others in the future of digital technologies , i made very much worried about the <unk> .
and to just to limit the risk of this new things , we need to end up the capacity of individuals that are basically to make the access to <unk> .
i think the challenge we &apos;re standing before we are , i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is that we &apos;re going to develop this <unk> of the back with the the way that will be using us from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , you &apos;ve all kinds of these kinds of incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last few of a little curriculum , and he &apos;s got to 400 million dollars , which is quite substantial for us .
and if you use the concept of <unk> <unk> , you can be a much more powerful entity -- the entity of the market -- to deliver feedback .
so 12 years ago , i started to <unk> science , and shifted my research into this direction .
wonderful and gloomy things .
there &apos;s ice on there .
so they &apos;re a <unk> form of living .
it &apos;s actually so much energy for biology in this cave , that actually there are a large number of <unk> .
we can see them .
we realized that a few years ago that caves have been many of the characteristics that were used by people and other organisms used to be used for habitat .
and if you &apos;re a goal to take a target , to just a certain steps , and then <unk> , just to be taken .
and so it &apos;s as well as they , the great greek mathematician .
<unk> was made on this , and it was given under tremendous <unk> .
that is , before we could start to digitize the <unk> , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by using electrons fly around the speed of light , they give x-rays .
this was a bad idea , because <unk> of <unk> had a son named alexander &apos;s great , and she lost the battle of <unk> .
because at least , their data , their data with <unk> and so much more .
the original <unk> of the bottle was one of the 18th century <unk> .
i asked , 160 dollars for what ?
she has four balconies .
a schematic schematic is that many of these things come from japan -- you &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet .
there was an object that i could not get in the finger , and that was the <unk> cheval blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- call my taste the one , so it &apos;s not necessarily relevant that i was not so much that i was not the only there , with this reaction .
the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid sold on it for a <unk> .
the real interesting thing is in is that you can measure them .
well , i could develop a game with the name of <unk> , just by taking a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if there are real boxes , we can &apos;t do a lot , but in a game , we say , &quot; ok .
this is absolutely critical and schizophrenia is it .
and i &apos;d like to tell you a quick story , in 1999 , there was a video game called <unk> .
it &apos;s about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and neurological insights that we get when we observe people playing .
it &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> , which is officially as a <unk> .
i &apos;m ellen , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with food .
there are hunger in america , 120 million people and almost <unk> million children .
and their farms are also big .
it &apos;s the 30th anniversary of <unk> corn and the big <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the way we &apos;re in america and the change the way we &apos;re agriculture .
this is a <unk> that i get two years ago , and that was one of the greatest projects i and my company was the involved .
but i &apos;m going to talk to the beginning of the process , which is three very <unk> .
if we are good , in what we do , we should not be able to create an architectural manifestation , which is perfectly annoying through the <unk> and <unk> bottlenecks ?
the architectural implementation was , and it &apos;s simple .
and this is the best for the trouble .
the second technology we we use , we &apos;re using things that you know about the <unk> of a opera .
this is the <unk> configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how to collect stories , in a little bit .
one of these projects is about a year and a half .
this is the pictures that automatically will be automatically .
as long as i wake up , i had the camera around the neck .
you can see a timeline , which shows you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s <unk> . well , well , etc .
a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> farmer .
what if you found out a year , the truth , what would you do the next 35 years of their lives ?
&quot; money deserve and open a business , &quot; was indian <unk> .
while he was told he was he wanted to be it , and he had given a about a <unk> of chance of chance .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , writing has absolutely benefits .
and with the hand , it &apos;s almost impossible , except in <unk> , and then the communication is limited .
very funny people , if lol is that means .
you don &apos;t do that in a way .
if someone had seen in 1973 on a black board of in 1993 , the <unk> would have been a little different for the &quot; love , &quot; but he understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the <unk> , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at my work next week at the whitney and also look at the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
afghanistan , not an existential threat to the global security .
and the same is true for the forces .
instead , there was a <unk> of <unk> optimism .
diplomats are in <unk> .
and finally , we have to understand that the secret of what we went in bosnia and kosovo , the secret to our <unk> was a lot of our humility -- in the careful of our <unk> .
rory , they mentioned libya to the conclusion .
so here &apos;s two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger to show you a fundamental thing that looks like .
there &apos;s also <unk> , which will be <unk> , but if you &apos;re these <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s used to use this for a different type of <unk> .
the <unk> . that &apos;s a difficult problem for reasons i &apos;m not going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s another , very interesting connection . and this is what you want to do is to engage in order of information on a general relatively bad <unk> .
so , i think it has the minimal food that we probably can reach to make things .
and we decided that we &apos;re not so much about it to be in terms of the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book called &quot; what &apos;s the <unk> of kansas ? &quot;
so we have to ask ourselves why .
but nevertheless , you don &apos;t interact with people who are not as as you are .
so we can think of things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m joking , but only , if i say that in the hospital you will have to believe in the hospital , if you get to a missing limb , without the mri and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
then bell bell on his students .
within a few years in the late 19th , early 20th century , the doctor was resolved by the doctor who tried to diagnose a diagnosis , the <unk> .
between the patient and the the doctors in terms of the best health care and the best of the best health care and the real dialectic .
another experience i did in texas , before i went to stanford , i was influenced by the .
the bad news : the exact cause we don &apos;t know , and see ? that can you do that we can do . &quot;
i remember so many big , <unk> , and i was looking at the inside of this ritual .
some call us <unk> , a rather <unk> term .
in this case , we tested it .
to you , there , there , here , &quot; then , what happened is a miracle !
and there was no way to <unk> .
religious <unk> .
it is harder to move the dead to a answer .
my friend simon singh , a <unk> , <unk> , wrote the big bang , &quot; and so on .
and now , you open your eyes .
you can open it all , and he &apos;s <unk> .
but it has me to think about that these guys , at least , know , what they do for a living .
everybody thought that was impossible .
you can generate lots of change . you can build roads .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s people like to do .
you don &apos;t need any .
hugo <unk> has invented the <unk> <unk> and middle class in venezuela . he just led them .
and so it goes on .
they connect people with each other .
the reason ?
there &apos;s another catch .
that makes him <unk> <unk> times more than less than <unk> , and over 400 times , as our total <unk> of pancreatic cancer .
my experiences with the islamic world , but it &apos;s a very different .
there &apos;s example , the figure out b.
and why leads sex to babies , and why are babies in relationships in relationships ?
because it &apos;s the secret of the desire .
very , very important to this description of the other or my self -- that &apos;s the same thing -- particularly interesting is that there &apos;s no <unk> of the desire .
this is her <unk> and <unk> , that &apos;s biology , which is natural instinct .
and then , it starts to take the desire . this study takes curiosity , <unk> .
you know that there is a <unk> space that belongs to each other .
other places in the country had similar rooms .
in a <unk> cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
it &apos;s usually played in smaller rooms .
so early <unk> have a <unk> <unk> .
so i asked myself , ok , is this a model for design , that adaptation that we practice ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; well , &quot; there &apos;s me !
how do we solve three problems that i want to bring here to the language ?
albert einstein -- i just talked to someone who was a speech , and i met mr. einstein .
what are it going to live ? why am i here ?
i never read a talk or a lecture or a lecture .
and there were about 300 people there .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later , &quot; rarely have a powerful powerful <unk> of the authority of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was , what he argued .

i was never in .
harvest <unk> .
and with tears , in the eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
2010 : a young woman is about president <unk> and says , how they and their siblings , their parents died in the war .
we &apos;re going to rural areas and everything we do , what &apos;s happening in this room is we create a room .
i failed .
i want to look back and see , 20 years , and see that there &apos;s a <unk> girl , a <unk> , <unk> girl , <unk> girls on the ted stage .
lg : you &apos;d like to happen .
licklider foresaw , computer can do the necessary to do insights to prepare insights and make decisions .
each other is being recorded by the more sensors : your credit card , your credit card , your computer , and it &apos;s a lot of data and we get the opportunity to understand our finding more possible .
these records were human <unk> .
by being introduced a <unk> process , which is a task for 40 people , about three months , was a very simple task for three people in 40 hours . all of all , are <unk> .
we should stop looking outside .
to dinner with my wife and the children .
because people say , &quot; suck man , i don &apos;t want to be <unk> or you want to get a time .

in the era of katrina , we have more common in common .
and they all have done it , and if not , you will have to be it .
help me make green to the new black , and help me to make sustainability sexy .
so i thought this would be a chance to use scratch , to make a interactive card for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical about what this <unk> .
in this case , you take a <unk> , puts it on a stack and the stack of <unk> , which is the behavior of the different characters in a game or a story in this case that &apos;s big fish .
and when you learn to code , you can program to program .
when kids create these projects like this , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i &apos;d like to talk about today to give you a background , is the thought that cars are art .
so that &apos;s one i want to talk .
and i think that this thought that great cars is a soul , very decent . you all know that . you know that , you know , a car with the first sight . you know how strong it is .
this is one of my favorite <unk> that really describes our relationship with cars .
right ? and they decided that it would be cheaper , instead of a studio and six or seven apartments to <unk> <unk> <unk> house in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt very close to this day , and we &apos;re separated by , and we <unk> the concept for the most of true of true and creativity .
we didn &apos;t bring it to boston .
and i &apos;ve just got a little lab .
now we &apos;ve been now in a clinical trials in four <unk> of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of <unk> and <unk> that can allow us to <unk> us that .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you have to think is that we have to do with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with the 100 billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained , why the entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to that , we have a good theory that can explain this case , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and so , although the universe will continue forever , and a typical matter and radiation will have a certain amount of radiation , some of its <unk> fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give the big fluctuations .
it cools down .
it &apos;s a <unk> fact of the universe that you accept and not question .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future that i could not accept .
now i &apos;d like to do something out there , like me to the africans and the poor people who are struggling with their dreams .
no matter what movement i did in my real world , i was doing with a little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in 2000 .
i took that very literally , i took my <unk> , and i sat him a little bit <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the camera is not just understanding my movements , but it &apos;s also capable of understanding things that i think in my hand .

this is juan , king of spain .
this is the third <unk> park in the june of june this year .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep underneath the earth to build a stop .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example .
almost every year we have these horrible <unk> .
we &apos;re under the average of the average in terms of the city .
a city of the future is a city that anybody am to rely out of this great community , which are cities .
the best answer is to try to reconstruct a darwinian <unk> from our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is , so that it &apos;s sort of gravity , so that it makes you feel that it &apos;s just to look at it .
and some of them are in every case to be a lot of the to the battles of the battles .
our strong reaction to images , for expression in the art , to the expression of emotion in the art sky , the sky will be in us and our offspring , as long as the human race .
well it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see here like the computer that sees the environment , and you can &apos;t see the vibrating , we actually <unk> the driver , even with red leds , so that he really can see what &apos;s happening .
and let mark see if mark can avoid .
or for blind people , in mundane , in the household , in education and in office .
a subtle <unk> had begun . the <unk> , the normal people don &apos;t listen votes , and i heard her , meant something that was something that was not going to me .
my mental <unk> was a catalyst for <unk> , mail and <unk> and sexual <unk> , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , you &apos;d better be better because cancer is easier to cure as schizophrenia . &quot;
to <unk> <unk> , when the social change starts , he can &apos;t be more <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re through now .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is that we should look for life , rather than mars , but mars , of course , a lot of <unk> and more interesting place .
and the usual astronomers were so <unk> .
because it &apos;s <unk> that compared to the life of life out there , it has tremendous benefits to the life on a planet .
there was another object , this is a <unk> piece of furniture with creatures and <unk> and tide -- pretty <unk> things for a little kid .
the first projects were modest , but they assumed technology and turned it to change the things that people could use a new type and perhaps have a new functionality .
the other thing is the <unk> is to <unk> , is that we decided to make all the gadgets , this whole <unk> , and tried to make it as beautiful as possible .
so we called y water . so that &apos;s another example of which is all in a room where everything is going to happen in a room , the three-dimensional design , the ideas that brand is the brand of interconnected .
this is my <unk> anthony , in switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to take it back with the back . it was hard .
yves behar : the design of objects that tell stories
thank you .
my aunt , an incredibly <unk> and brilliant woman , was a early of a widow .

they have to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation that grow up in a world where everything is <unk> and in the number of our best talks on a screen .
and finally , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
and if you wonder why this is interesting at all , you have to look at the rest of saudi arabia because there &apos;s a country that &apos;s used to the males &apos;s <unk> .
maybe some of the things are bad traditions and they need to change .
let me give you an example of : in turkey , which is a very <unk> republic , and recently , i was a <unk> to the <unk> which are protecting the universities against <unk> students .
if i think the only person who thinks that &apos;s how , we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as muslims europe saw , they were independent , they were independent .
that &apos;s why the eu process , the efforts of turkey , the eu join , in turkey by the pious muslims while some of the previous nations were against it .
there &apos;s a very large nose that doesn &apos;t come to the appearance of anything that would be connected to anything .
if scientists today , a century , in fact , can be visible to be able to make it up from the inside of the inside of you .
carl <unk> : how insights inside of our brain
that trend is very much less .
but for many parts of africa , it took a colleague of me , &quot; the <unk> <unk> on the evening , right now , was the the <unk> on the <unk> . &quot;
and instead of bringing the local leaders , local leaders soon and have <unk> , from the second <unk> , the events of the <unk> , of 2001 and the wars in <unk> and in iraq .

<unk> moved across continents . the big migration began .
some of the mammals went back into the water .
every man should have a <unk> .
but there was nothing for this purpose , so we &apos;ve got to <unk> with prostate prostate cancer , and then we have to create our motto that is &quot; the face of the man &apos;s health . &quot;
mo <unk> from canada , from the united states , and from england , and we call us and and we call us and and they call us , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .

a life , through everything , through the cultural revolution , and everything that came to , he gathered today about eight million pieces in the museum , the contemporary chinese history .

<unk> <unk> opens up the eyes for a new view on the world of india and the west -- and shows why these <unk> systems of the <unk> , the <unk> of the death and the <unk> help us to help us feel consistent .
but you know what ? it &apos;s almost <unk> and the world , &quot; i &apos;m completely , and absolutely competent , &quot; means to defeat himself with the toughest .
you &apos;re interested in comparison compared to what ?
their friends and family will gather around the <unk> , and there , on her grave , a tombstone , on which says , &quot; here lies a great engineer that invented <unk> . &quot;
you &apos;re happy . that &apos;s the conversation that i want to hear the mothers and fathers , because your kid &apos;s good at math , and you know what comes next .
that &apos;s because they -- you know what they &apos;re .
i don &apos;t have patents , and i &apos;ve never given money from a medical medical court , and i don &apos;t realize that they choose me .
so where do you know , your breast is high density ?
so , <unk> has more biopsies that is in the relationship to other technologies , and it &apos;s not very common .

the image of the mbi shows that a lot of a lot of a lot of a , as much as a second tumor that is strong on the surgical possibilities of patient .
it costs a radiologists in particular education to be a in a <unk> in order to distinguish normal discrete detail from a <unk> detail .
some women who get breast cancer , many years later , and luckily most years , most of the .

we gather out of the physicists in the <unk> to see what they build .
mill .
they slept in this <unk> factory .
that &apos;s a naive vision .
it &apos;s a question of the consequences .
so let &apos;s get to the point .
what did i do ? i heard my belly on my belly ?
that &apos;s interesting . that &apos;s another way to think .
the <unk> is basically a visualization of a human being where any body is proportionate to the surface that it takes in the brain .
this is white noise .
and db is probably going to roll up in your direction .

and he said , after a long silence , &quot; i wonder , <unk> , if people are not going to find the <unk> in the 1980s than my videos . &quot;
that &apos;s the reason that i &apos;m doing with david edward , a scientist at harvard , an object that made the toxic elements with these plants .

ue : no . it &apos;s just smoke .
and i &apos;ll meet some scientists .
so i had the hope that by putting some natural elements , a little bit of fog , and i could make the space material .
<unk> is , it &apos;s a difference to do something or not .
the big mountains in the distance are moving less .
how do we create a notion that is becoming tolerant to individuality , and also , to <unk> without the two in two different directions ?

<unk> <unk> : ng : how the one .
we &apos;re in the national aquarium in the national aquarium , and for research , for research and maintaining .
but we thought , quite quickly that we made a system that connects people to each other .
today . this is the first time you &apos;re talking about this issue .
this is a picture of me and my daughter on the one of the israeli flag .
&quot; because it works , make a poster with me . &quot;

what i &apos;d like to talk about is the biggest problems in the world .
but it &apos;s a problem , if you &apos;re a problem , when you &apos;re dealing with people to focus on problems .
so what i &apos;m really <unk> is to say that we have a very long time , a situation where we had a number of choices .
and then , ask , why economists ?
but it &apos;s what we can do about it , too much , too much .
the <unk> of malaria is to a few million infected per year .
what &apos;s happening here is that we think about our priorities .
it &apos;s a good film about that i want to see him , is true , but don &apos;t expect to <unk> brad pitt &apos;s to <unk> brad &apos;s <unk> in tanzania or something like that .

if i was a suicide bombers to look at the younger than i , or in my age , i feel so inspired by her <unk> .
and that will be arrived , just there , from <unk> , who hopefully hope in the middle of the time , particularly armed with the just the moment of this question .
is the internet actually a place to visit ?
and the landscape is changing . three years ago , when i started to deal with this , was just a wire along the african west coast , which is here in this map of steve song as thin black line .
and that &apos;s not right .
this data is called layer at layer at the device , starting with the device that , starting with the the product of the product , and it puts the material layer in a <unk> process that &apos;s going to <unk> the old layer .
it was made by <unk> by about four <unk> .
there &apos;s a less likely to be less .
they can just make it directly from place .
here &apos;s the product .
without any doubt , i believe that this technology is going to create a revolution in production and the <unk> as we know it will .
he was worried that when he called her in this name , especially out , in the public , you could think he was the notion of jihad .
they use his <unk> .
the good news is that it &apos;s not that way .
but many of these factors that played a role , now , is even stronger . half of work is done .
i was with my friend susan <unk> , who was in the mathare valley slums .
she said , &quot; you know , poverty was not the bad . it was the indignity and the embarrassment of all the thing . &quot;
do you think i &apos;m going to miss the violence or the lack of privacy ?
first , instead of the time that over months , instead of going to fly and forgotten , the time was very much more nuanced .
but it &apos;s less likely to stay that they remain .
and during my first year , i did , my business .
it &apos;s actually told that more energy is required to create a solar cell than she will get into their entire transportation .
solar cells , and four hours of light .
and also , they are under large pressure , and they &apos;re dangerous .
this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s just a little cylinder down here , which is the canoe and all the <unk> in itself , and this is the hot hot , the hot cylinder -- that &apos;s hot , that &apos;s cold , and it comes electricity .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it can cool .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> , to use this energy as fast as we do it right now .
we bubbles it on and look at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying laboratory lab with that we did the measurements in the region of this molecule .
but i &apos;ve got sick of writing poetry and he never did the air cream in the air , but he &apos;s gone to cuba .
so , made of the things , made great things -- which i then put a painting , which is ultimately going to land in my work .
i work for the new yorker , and then 9 / 11 came , and that was , &quot; a <unk> of the world as we knew about .
and then , &quot; let &apos;s clear you &apos; <unk> ! be <unk> with the tongue , but that &apos;s how we understand it . &quot;
&quot; and he decided that his <unk> had to be extinct .
this man is angry , because somebody &apos;s been angry , and it &apos;s basically -- you know , <unk> <unk> to be a subject ...
and it &apos;s also a with george <unk> , so i don &apos;t think it &apos;s .
td : so since my youngest childhood , and after that , i had many of the principals to me , and when i was young , i was always like my journey was already .
that &apos;s beautiful , but we should remember that a similar process should be on on the inner level .
td : lakshmi has been incredibly hard , even for my invitation , let me , and all of all , what she did was doing that , and i was very <unk> , and i was very nervous for this entire week .
in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned in the simulated and the other ones that have learned in the reality .
when i say , &quot; we &quot; i mean , i &apos;m going to <unk> the advice for <unk> .
but nobody believes that it will actually be very effective if there &apos;s a real outbreak .
the biggest part of the time in the administration administration is actually more in with anthrax and the threat through a <unk> <unk> .
we know that the virus will be -- it &apos;s going to be a different virus .
but in the scientific community , there &apos;s a <unk> debate on which percentage of the <unk> between people through <unk> and coughing , and how much of the things happen .
some of the poorest countries that have been in most of h5n1 experience , led to the drugs that are already up .
and i think , even our leaders would say that we have a lot of to do .
i &apos;m pleased to answer your questions .
our centers for <unk> have been developed one of them , we developed , as fast <unk> .
and in the most <unk> , the similar bacterial infections that was not a problem .
now don &apos;t pay attention to how much fun you have to do it , but how to make power change the way the <unk> changes the way to interact with a city like san francisco .
please , please put a <unk> .
i &apos;m a a young juggler with a <unk> of a force , and he <unk> to sell me three clubs .
since my childhood , i played with <unk> and climbing , the case is toast . i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
manhattan is not more an infinite .
so , i &apos;m not going to be here , right ?
i stay in the middle .
she was one , i was the <unk> .
because the leaves leaves and branches it is very dark and very quietly .
i and my colleagues of the <unk> are looking for the dynamics of the <unk> that live in the forest .
we &apos;re advising us with the media on <unk> ; we have a <unk> ; we have <unk> .
and then the students came in our <unk> , and they have their own <unk> <unk> with their own beats .
and our new project is that the people and we learn to grow the frog , <unk> <unk> , which was a high endangered spread in the states of washington and oregon .
he said , &quot; look what you hide in front of you . &quot;
that &apos;s why we see a rising demand for <unk> , and so that &apos;s why it &apos;s why .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you have to believe me , trust me . &quot;
that day , i learned two really important things .
the deeper we go underwater , the is the pressure .
so i started about 15 years ago .
the air is out , the air is the air in the air , the air comes out of the <unk> .
and each of these computers can do the entire system , so if two of them are out there are still reserves .
but this is what it looks like , and that habitat is still on , over many miles .
so sharks are not quite as dangerous as most people you represent .
and when we found it , we were not even sure what to say , which is he called him <unk> , which was what he looked like , he came out of his books .
it wastes a <unk> and he <unk> .
that means that every one and every one of you know , every one of you know , at least a child , which is a <unk> .
and his communication and social interaction evolved so <unk> that he could go to a normal school and even a <unk> .
it &apos;s like a little like life : if you &apos;re in it , you can &apos;t get it out .
i know you &apos;ve never heard him , but you &apos;ll notice that day , one day , you &apos;ll be hearing by him because he &apos;s an amazing man . &quot;
nk : no , he died 25 years ago .
he had over every crowd , he loved everybody .
we all , we all , what happens when a <unk> of hydrogen and helium , so long as long as it it starts to ask about their origins .
these <unk> evidence shows that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to estimate the diversity and the incredible scale of life on this planet , and in the first step , to have a lot of a time in all bets .
so it &apos;s going to be silicon as important as aluminum , and we will expand it in the future , it &apos;s sensitive to 350 antennae , it &apos;s sensitive to its gradual and the moore &apos;s law of its gradual
and then we &apos;d like to make the <unk> search for the human <unk> .
a lot of say it &apos;s the best place in the world to study the development of climate change .
every cylinder is a <unk> of time .
while they <unk> with the ice , they put a extra pair of gloves in a oven so that you can make a new pair of pair , if your <unk> <unk> and your finger are stiff .
i think of this point of a little <unk> of <unk> .
and our soldiers are really happy to be <unk> to the <unk> of the police cabinet , if they &apos;re actually listed to service to <unk> american <unk> .
you can still go that further , and efficiency has almost to triple the efficiency with a few more <unk> enhancement , and that &apos;s the co2 rate of the major ocean .
we could build larger cars , which would be done for security , but easy should be .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan , because we have to protect our <unk> <unk> and the others .
and by the <unk> , by the <unk> mass mass mass of these kinds of materials , or in this case , to create <unk> <unk> , as good <unk> ; the <unk> , the same thing that it has been made for the internet .
it &apos;s not just to be a giant <unk> conspiracy called doing .
there were two kinds of negative feedbacks that we have .
hope we hope that it really is stable .
oops , i &apos;m wrong with <unk> .
he ended up , a dutch <unk> named arrested by a a guy who had a wonderful vermeer selling him a prize for about 10 million dollars .
according to his <unk> , &quot; he saw , as he saw the first time that it &apos;s bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it comes on . what &apos;s it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how are they find them how much they &apos;re attracted to <unk> or romantic , depends on the key of what you think about who you think about .
but each of these three objects has a value beyond what it takes , because of its story .
but i don &apos;t want to have a copy , even though i can &apos;t recognize the difference .
so he brought his joshua bell , he was taking his <unk> in washington d.c. , to a corner of the corner , and see how much money he will take .
the second shock hurts less , because you &apos;re a little bit used to it .
and if you zoom in , you can see that there &apos;s a kind of political <unk> .
they <unk> that you &apos;re a <unk> , <unk> member of the american <unk> of <unk> , which is very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat vegetables and olive oil , fewer <unk> .
the <unk> is one of the most fascinating things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a <unk> conclusion , if you &apos;re a drug in such a <unk> that it will have more side side side , and that your new drug will look better .
the big trials are closer to the real answer .
that &apos;s a problem for that &apos;s currently not a solution .
and very soon , they &apos;d have , these coal , the coal , <unk> around 2,000 , <unk> around <unk> , <unk> around china and everywhere in the world .
can you imagine how they feel like , if you &apos;d be in my mind ?
it &apos;s about the oil ; you know that , all know that .
there is this thing , the <unk> of the world , and that comes from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
man , the americans , are kind of like , &quot; ah , <unk> .
these christians are <unk> .
they generalize . this is wrong .
and the soldiers are , and all the other is chinese .
can you imagine that maybe one of you who would be down to his child , and it puts a and say , &quot; darling , i &apos;m back back .
everything has changed .
and all this has had enormous impacts on the world .
i think thomas jefferson has really been really good in words in words .
for the <unk> in the audience , even why they have a bigger budget than <unk> , and that &apos;s because of <unk> <unk> has become easier to other languages and cultures . so the market for these films are bigger .
but it will happen in this century .
this is not the u.s. <unk> of the united states , which is going to be on a million , but gdp per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
and also , like everyone here knows -- it &apos;s not the oil .
my election is the peak of a lifelong commitment to grow up on the gulf of the gulf of the <unk> on the <unk> .
a lot of our actions on this planet that are affecting our environment , are just by believe and what &apos;s motivated .
one has been a for thousands or millions of years .
we need to calm down before we go to the planet .
e.o. wilson : the life of life on earth
another <unk> is the very european european <unk> .
the genome of the passenger pigeon contains 1.3 billion base pairs .
the reversal of extinction falls into this category .
real falcon , <unk> chicken .
and it &apos;s a program to <unk> , which is very brilliant .
this is an emotional subject . some people are up .
my grandmother was a <unk> .
i also did my own comics , that was another way to tell stories about words , through words and through images .
and we sat down there , in silence and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
using your own style . draw not how to tell you .
&quot; rather jarrett , i get your <unk> .
i &apos;ll also publish a book book called &quot; <unk> police : the <unk> police . &quot;
sound affects us continually physiological , psychologically , cognitively and <unk> .
this is a 32 million pounds , an important <unk> that was built in britain recently designed by a british <unk> .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected .
people who say , don &apos;t leave the team to the team because the noise like and the other .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , a new business business , who his life in the suitcase and the and reality and reality is , and it &apos;s not capable of getting both into the same .
<unk> <unk> and and a half and work after a <unk> , which was a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> talented actors .
i know theater connects us .
now , now , the time we can use the diversity of our talents to create a intelligent , important and extraordinary work .
if you look at the bathroom , you &apos;ll see more of the products like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but also toothpaste .
<unk> collagen -- or , since the 1970s , collagen of pigs , it &apos;s used to inject it into fold .
and i found 115 products in all , i found 185 products .
and i said , &quot; my love , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve got a long and a year before you . &quot;
i said you to be that , you should be that , &quot; i am somebody .
they have given me that feeling , in a time , in which i felt like one one was a time .
they &apos;re working on the morning , so it &apos;s beginning to the 1930s , and now the the b.
hundreds of verbs can behave like this .
you can see that as language , you can see , or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so the puzzle is , why bribes , be polite requests , <unk> and <unk> so often ?
you can try to imagine what if language could be used to be used in the same way .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with this .
here &apos;s my argument . is it &apos;s sustainable ? is it good ?
it makes it <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
what insight that you won , to convince me ?
all of these different roles . can you imagine a argument where they &apos;re in , but also in the audience , and you see in the world ?
or -- and that &apos;s the most part of me : we want to do that we &apos;re in the world of nature . we bring a <unk> and find the masters of the conformity in nature that might inspire us .
and that changed everything . from there , these engineers don &apos;t get into the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the <unk> national lab .
that would be <unk> fuel cells if they could get away without a <unk> .
it &apos;s not easy , because life is just a subset of elements in the <unk> .
feeling and respond , feedback is very important .
what you can &apos;t see , you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a <unk> . i started under the taliban .
in south korea and indonesia are almost half a million companies .
because , like the <unk> , you can see smaller <unk> in direct relation to <unk> economic <unk> .
and the world in all world are not exceptions .
people <unk> whether this <unk> and the miracle .
i &apos;ve <unk> a <unk> <unk> of happy , <unk> cows on my <unk> , and i &apos;d like a paper towel to <unk> it .
first , we were torn out .
what does that mean ?
and when i started to do with them , i realized that they have incredibly well adapted .
but the researchers had a problem .
until they finally started to take their degree and then the campus -- and certainly happy to come there -- and i was sure , some days later back back and realized that crows still remembered .
we found that they are really smart and they can teach them to each other .
and for instance , after the <unk> , come after looking for the peanut .
but there were three problems , three puzzles that i couldn &apos;t solve and i want to talk about it , but more importantly , i found a <unk> .
who would ever hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen , because every region has something to offer .
let me make the connection .
you know , there &apos;s the <unk> of the future . you have to understand that .
that &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be the johnny <unk> of the sounds .
they have about 10 million <unk> .
and here we see , with the words of the radiologists israel , &quot; like the hand in a way , arrest by <unk> . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i wouldn &apos;t be eating to the end , if you don &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should make an experiment .
he had a line in his book that &apos;s supposed to come from the <unk> , there was a <unk> mary , the trouble with conception .
so now , you have a evolutionary assessment .
she said , i have to read them what she said , because i find it so beautiful .
that &apos;s a very unfortunate . not , because i want to use it , i wanted to see him .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our story .
now , i have thought to that moment that at the age of 50 , one of the skills that i really got the , i was , my shoes .
first of all , i have to say that i &apos;m not from here .
yes . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know so much to know where to put the different colors .
but i can see in their faces , they &apos;re still a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i decided to have a fun , and before i left the room in the morning , i &apos;ll find some things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all in there .
my father was a , so my youth was so interesting .
that &apos;s just a moment .
i &apos;m , &quot; right now , i &apos;m fine -- i put the wheels . &quot; out of the protest , i bought the <unk> wheels , and i built them on and -- you &apos;d go to see my <unk> ?
it just sounds , but i think we &apos;re in in our society in general and culture with the <unk> .
he designed the <unk> himself , and he was really proud of it .
boy , i love the thing .
the implications of a planet , on that already , we live seven billion people .
and very , very proud of the , he was on the cushy seat , the real tail , he had hiked his <unk> , and the beautiful <unk> around the seat .
intent -- a life with intent -- that &apos;s been aware of the original something better .
i saw the healthy mass of one left , and i was <unk> that she was lost , <unk> all of what i didn &apos;t have done , but not more possible .
and then i started to ask , as many times , to ask , how much of my life would have been otherwise , if that didn &apos;t have bothered me when my genes have had another one of experience .
i was , but i was , but i was now , in fact , i was , and that , i guess , i did myself myself .
i had a very humble to hoped that was a very simpler , to trade in the turkish <unk> for four words and back to my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his <unk> for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we work with the machine <unk> laboratory at the university of california , san diego .
first , the perception of people , and the second , a natural interface , a natural form of control , so that the interaction that the robot is intuitive to the robot to deliver more intuitive .
and yet , i made this idea of their own .
after i realized that economic danger , i thought we have to find a solution to this problem .
some of these guys have been shown in the speaker of how to speak to nathan <unk> , or the one of tim ferriss , the occasionally might be considered .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk who contains it .
this time i paid 25 cents , because i found the job harder to do .
and yet , there was one of what was sure all was , the expansion had to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in mind , because i &apos;m going to show you three <unk> to string theory .
the <unk> went up at about 10 high .
and he was working decades of explaining this number , but he didn &apos;t succeed , and we know why .
each of these universes has extra dimensions .
because the astronomers of today is using these powerful telescopes to heaven , discovering a handful of photons photons -- a kind of <unk> <unk> , billions of years .
well , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
remember , it &apos;s the first time you meet it , and we want to make them really excited and to do anything .
he said , &quot; go , milo . <unk> . &quot;
pm : this is dimitri &apos;s so right in <unk> .
we don &apos;t know anybody here .
the next moment , the phone does not work anymore , the tv is all , the tv is , the <unk> of the street there are <unk> .
it was a very grim meeting of the reporters who worked in the war , the staff of organizations , and of course , the fearless , brave people of sarajevo themselves .
and if i asked , why i &apos;m going to go on , why i &apos;m going to stay in the reason .
but it &apos;s my job of this testament to <unk> , and that is the <unk> , the core of the thing , for us .
even before a goal appears to the joystick to try <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the the destination , no matter where it is .
basically , we &apos;re the animals that they learned to explore this <unk> and objects in the virtual world .
in an experiment that we did in a few years ago we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so dai manju was finished the <unk> .
raise your hand .
the last reason has to do with it , that women &apos;s part of the solution , not the problem .
in niger , one of seven women in average , one of seven women in childbirth .
it became part of the solution , not the problem .
larry <unk> , as he <unk> as a <unk> of the world bank , once said , &quot; it can be good for education in education in the developing world , in the developing world . &quot;
that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> &apos;s book .
and that was the spring of a bird .
this whole <unk> is one of our <unk> , telling us that there &apos;s a <unk> .
and even this image , the suspect of the suspect of being <unk> -- like something from <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> <unk> .
one of the ways that we were , we could have a retreat in small byproducts .
they put their arrowheads and say , &quot; i want to have these arrowheads to the left . we share 50 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island where they can make all three or four miles on a new language .
if 27 individuals from these 27 member member of the table , their 23 languages , and then they just telling you a <unk> of <unk> that they will need to need a army of <unk> to be prepared for all the most <unk> possible .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they did it in language .
and what i &apos;m most interested in is the invisible room between a text and the other image , and how the image is changing through the text and the text through the image .
this is <unk> <unk> that &apos;s going to go across the bottom of the atlantic ocean and the north america with europe .
they &apos;re a negative .
but by the notion of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> can change the <unk> .
larry <unk> was eight years of a $ 10 years of a <unk> sentence in arizona , to <unk> kidnapping and over <unk> of a <unk> boy on a <unk> .
before , there are people to leave themselves .
and they &apos;ve brought them for us here to the texas .
and now , you drive with the <unk> where they &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the vastness of space that &apos;s going to look like it , and it &apos;s not happening .
this is something called hooked on a sense , the pursuit of happiness and human design .
part is the legacy of <unk> , the <unk> who thought that the pursuit of happiness for <unk> was struggling , it &apos;s going to be from <unk> aspects of individuals and could not find in reality .
a <unk> in science of happiness , happiness and <unk> are not going to represent a <unk> continuum .
it starts in the <unk> .
here &apos;s a three weeks .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one way to increase the status , that is dominance .
i &apos;d like to close with a few quotes .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat has understood that , we make a little bit more .
you can actually cure t.b. even in people who are hiv-positive .
knowing that a patient , the microscopic <unk> is , to 15 people infected -- 15 healthy people -- a year , you can be sure we &apos;ve been saved a lot of lives .
here &apos;s a neurons here .
so it &apos;s important for imitation and <unk> .
now , the question is , if i just watch another person being touched , why am i not confused and have literally watching this <unk> of the naked , as someone being touched ?
thank you . i &apos;ve got two missions here today .
i don &apos;t really go to the <unk> , but to take the pollen itself .
all of these pictures were taken by a <unk> by the way in the lab from kew .
even every one of us has a story to tell us a story on us .
we have to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to tackle this crisis .
right to the 1980s , when we saw women and death of heart disease , and they were growing up to the new england journal of medicine and called the <unk> .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for women whose breast <unk> , who <unk> the orders of the patient , and , and we &apos;re building something that is just a small amount of radiation , we ask , &quot; is this test actually need really ? &quot;
okay , here we started .
they did what they said they were <unk> , and they &apos;ve joined it .
the cells have such a bit like <unk> ; in the dish , they don &apos;t feel to the native .
what does that mean for us ?
over three years , we took eight to 10 hours of hours , collected a <unk> hours of <unk> and <unk> .
this is one of the first <unk> , which is something more than a year ago that really was really surprised .
and finally , my son alone in a <unk> .
three of the most important people in this project , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> roy <unk> here to see here .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time that our son would be more than two steps on the movie .
and that &apos;s a important thing to <unk> question , because the better we understand how the brain is important , the better we can communicate . i think , the better we can think of ourselves and work .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh , i have a strong or emotional response to the . &quot;
what we &apos;re literally doing is our teams of <unk> to draw the whole <unk> on a big wall .
that &apos;s the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just hygiene , but also for relaxation for relaxation .
so , there &apos;s not a .
if you put it into the building industry , if you have a <unk> and a window , and then we say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that needs to be repaired .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we went on .
are we just stupid ?
you can see it in two years when you read eight hours a day .
so , in september , can you , and say , &quot; i &apos;m important .
why are you not going to do that , and why do you don &apos;t do that ? &quot;
and the police waiting to get the fire fire to make the vehicle in order to get the driver &apos;s body .
and that &apos;s enough to the present with the <unk> in the united states , on the one of the divine .
and all of that leads us -- <unk> , just to name the time , which is what we &apos;re most doing to use digital devices .
that &apos;s the consequence of the destruction of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right side .
that &apos;s a very , very low level to be released from the medical system .
he would then , my jaw in the right position , and he <unk> my teeth .
alfred man is a brilliant physicist and agent who is fascinated , and to close , to just a deaf to the ear or a blind person , or a blind thing , or a paralyzed .
now , i had to go out in the dark years that followed out what was going to me , if anything that was particularly made .
and it works . it works .
<unk> : so if you have the opportunity , you spend time with simon .
and these were the developing world : they had large families and a relatively short life .
and the ones here are on this page . a large <unk> of africa .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china and brought it back to a middle .
a search of which we can copy the data into a two-dimensional form and and what we &apos;re going to be able to put if we look outwards ?
but this is what i did .
you know , darwin has explained life after it originated , but what was the essence of life ?
and i learned that francis crick know .
but it was what was in the literature .
we were not the best chemists in the room .
i was unhappy , my girls didn &apos;t marry me .
you can basically compare to these normal and diverse segments and <unk> segments .
and so let me close by that , by telling us that we &apos;ve looked at a lot of people with schizophrenia .
it costs that , in a case two million dollars , and it takes 18 months if they win .
first , don &apos;t have to fight the patent against the patent , against the <unk> .
my solution : give me this patent , and i will let them go to <unk> .
&quot; why don &apos;t ? &quot;
the fathers were in a place where they move her daughters to play their daughters , and they could reach their hands to the dance .
that &apos;s a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left to the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in people .
you can &apos;t see the enemy of the time , and so , we needed a different way to eradicate polio , when we had done it with smallpox .
it helped to control properly <unk> , sars for example .
the reality of polio today is something very different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now bruce , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce <unk> : how we will finally get polio to a standstill .
dj : we found this <unk> <unk> now in all kinds of animals , especially in the big big big big .
and to our astonishment , it became a <unk> .
for us , this elephant in many many ways , a symbol of inspiration , a symbol of that hope that accompanies us in our work .
it was incredibly amazing when it took it in security to protect it before the grass .
and of course , if i look at this <unk> , the <unk> , she reminds me a very scary way to a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your fate is in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and wife , as a community and as part of this planet and we need to keep on it .
after all , it seems to be clear that the earth is big and <unk> , the sun is small , and it &apos;s worth to remember what <unk> <unk> to once .
and that &apos;s because there &apos;s the ground in middle world is always there .
nature that model is on it , which kind of animal we are .
because there are so many of them , and because between them not have an consensus in terms of their <unk> , <unk> <unk> , as we see it in middle world , <unk> and stuck .
people as treating machines may be scientific and <unk> , but it &apos;s a <unk> of waste , if you want to guess what the disgruntled person will do next to do next .
and over night , i was , at the <unk> <unk> of 40 years of 40 years .
and so , a <unk> that i control with my head , allowing me to see this <unk> video of the robot and send to the <unk> into a <unk> of the <unk> .
and with people like we can do this dream .
so in the higgs oceanography , for example , a <unk> medical dictionary is designed by basically the <unk> that the dolphins , visualized .
i think we can form a global community .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
there are some of these guys -- there are some lessons that can learn from it .
but we don &apos;t usually do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is just 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem that we need to solve .
i also assume that most of you don &apos;t speak chinese -- what really sad is , if you think that this is the number of the most common language on the internet .
what if you &apos;re going to look at ? maybe we should do that .
and if you look at this image , you might think , &quot; why should you be interested in ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow it to take out and look at the world and find its place in it .
they would get wealth and security , the religious violence and make sure that states never have to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war , 20 million people took life -- until today the civil war civil war worldwide .
<unk> sen , who is this guy : &quot; i &apos;d also make all this money , but i &apos;ve spent all of these time to find the american man who had stolen to the prescription .
chinese restaurants have largely done , i would argue , with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even the restaurant -- even a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken , which started in in new york city , as i was in college in new york city , as i started in college in new york city in the early 1970s , so ...
so what we see in 17th , 18th century is the <unk> search for medicine , the same thing .
so the people would really have a big fit .
when the <unk> started , i was clearly <unk> , i was clearly <unk> , until i thought my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember , as a child has to come to every line ?
and 18 and 19 , i would sleep at night .
and again , i &apos;ll be depressed and <unk> more <unk> .
so many of us is that it &apos;s a lot of to do in the next few years , in building a better world .
it goes to be , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , where did the world worked in the treatment of the known problems that made out of the potential of earthquake and climate change ?
if you get the impossible , you get it possible .
but we &apos;ve achieved a deal with climate change .
and there was crying .
the <unk> does something remarkable : they used two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their spinneret to create a material that is a remarkably hard to conserve , is equivalent to technical fibers like kevlar .
or you &apos;re beautiful things like this , or you can catch it up in case the camera can catch it .
here &apos;s how it &apos;s taken off from the tissue .
with my new project , marilyn <unk> , i want to use art for using technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that which is to put and the and the <unk> and the <unk> -- hopefully not to help him to help some of their next decisions .
what should i do ? &quot;
in addition to this unprecedented demonstration , heather knight data ago , a <unk> that can be a lot more than <unk> -- he collects the feedback of his audience and you might be the answer to the answer to the answer .
stanley <unk> , inventor of the known <unk> <unk> of <unk> , who believed in the <unk> and <unk> , that it was between two to seven people to seven and seven .
how do our view of relationships are to <unk> groups ?
but there was a <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you , and where he might have to put that germans would have to be able to have this .
um ... my father , a <unk> ? !
it was his father , who decided they needed false papers .
that sense of responsibility about the life of others , he was given by 17 years , and also his fault , to be a <unk> , because he had caught out of a camp , while his friends were left , kept his his friends .
and while my <unk> and my <unk> gave up , were hospitalized , i had <unk> my father false papers .
i asked him , given the victims that he had to do if he had ever <unk> .
we &apos;re growing by a few million people to seven billion people that we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> after the next <unk> that is a good state .
if you <unk> the forests , the border , the border , you have the capacity to stay stable .
with the realization of <unk> , fishers , the <unk> great barrier reef reef and scientists that the great barrier reef is under the current <unk> .
but the drama is , of course , is that there is no option that change change is not an option .
that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today : because i really like media .
this is a <unk> of a race from far developed .
first , he uses a ancient kind of manufacturing , which is that <unk> and connected this with a three-dimensional perspective , which was a very new technology at that time .
and by the process of sugar , of black <unk> , i hired portraits of them .
it was very big images , and i took it to a very big camera on , a <unk> camera .
my interest in <unk> , particularly , very much , very far enough .
and then , there &apos;s a sequence that is also a sequence that looks like .
we can ask , there &apos;s a general general in general differences between africans and <unk> ?
and then you can compare it with the genome of living people with today .
we can then , for these these are the <unk> of the same , as a neanderthal , have you mixed with the ancestors of today ?
there are many people who designed their own vision , like this vision from the beginning of the 20th century .
after my conviction , the airplane is the airplane of the future .
imagine , <unk> growing in 3d printer and are embedded in a central organ , and follow the forces that occur in their components .
they didn &apos;t speak . but most importantly , they were exceptional isolated from the world around her , from her environment and from the people .
they would <unk> . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about 100 .
you can see a video .
you have the sense that the research that you &apos;re concerned with you really have a effect on reality that they actually started to prevent these experiences that i started my way from this area .
then you pick up .
<unk> <unk> you <unk> you in a rigid posture -- chin on the <unk> , arms <unk> on your <unk> .
they did it just as we &apos;ve taught them .
and after the battle , they bring these mobile auditorium , and what you calls &quot; <unk> , to teach you what you did wrong .
and the people have changed .
i asked , &quot; where is he ? &quot;
it &apos;s not just skydiving .
and she showed on the left thing to say to me , how problematic this image was , it was <unk> , which was black , as black was represented .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the <unk> that i have a new set of questions that i do .
well , that &apos;s a obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how should we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long did you do it until you decided that you haven &apos;t got anything ? &quot;
their <unk> increased to 50 , which is new delhi &apos;s worth of a <unk> biotechnology .
76 percent . i was a test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be <unk> vinci .
these are 10-year-old .
suddenly , i saw from the dark , from the darkness , the location of the location , the moon was <unk> off the moon .
if i have to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you some of the clips from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the tempest &quot;
and our little life ends into a sleep .
bono : they &apos;re <unk> .
i know you understand that .
so , blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both of play in africa .
it &apos;s another , which is acting on the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s take the markets as the <unk> <unk> , which we have , and figure out what price people would pay for the , so that you would have the election .
thank you .
the <unk> was , if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two <unk> , and 10 tv .
and this little <unk> of <unk> , to take out of its tracks , and that was a problem .
this is fine . it &apos;s slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video clip of a few of the models i work with .
tissue of <unk> density and behavior is the second part , and that is actually key to be able to use these models for <unk> .
thank you .
and trying to fly out of the way that we took an arrow on the <unk> end , and it was hard work , and boy , boy , boy , i &apos;ve learned a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s see the other side .
we work on projects -- even more sophisticated developments , like <unk> -- with darpa , which is called the california institute of technology and university of los angeles .
be careful , they behave like wood or so , like wood .
now i didn &apos;t try to be <unk> .
they go on forever .
that &apos;s about two billion .
it takes him for the estimation , for about three years of <unk> .
don &apos;t forget that one of the day .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time in which we live in the human mind and machines can win .
i &apos;ve got mass . where does it come from ?
it &apos;s too afraid that could be extinct in the wild or 30 years .
all of the evidence of <unk> on that cancer is transmitted from a virus .
i took the opportunity to and it took a couple of samples from jonas &apos; tumor , and a few samples from other parts of parts .
she brought him to his vet and this discovered something called a little bit .
and ultimately , cancer is a <unk> implication of the ability to share and adapt to their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would <unk> to wait for waiting for it .
and that &apos;s the third reason why don &apos;t have happy to make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t feel the numbers on them .
first , i &apos;m going to show you the <unk> for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion doesn &apos;t break , if we &apos;re aware of that <unk> .
but what we &apos;re going to see is in the 21st century , asia , that gradually comes to more than half the world &apos;s population and over half the global performance .
you could look at this as the privatization of the <unk> .
after 1958 , after 1958 , the soviets said , it was , &quot; that &apos;s the end of america . &quot;
if you &apos;re in japan or new delhi or <unk> , or <unk> , their view of china is going to be something different than if they &apos;re living in beijing in beijing .
and if we have strategies in which we are going to get this in a wider historical context , we will be able to do this process .
how do we define our national self-interest , so it &apos;s not just a <unk> <unk> of the other things that &apos;s positive .
that &apos;s the conventional approach .
this is the fact that responsibility forces to <unk> the <unk> forces to guarantee a stable <unk> .
they &apos;re on the long-term benefits .
for who ? who ? especially for young men .
after relieving the law , you can &apos;t even get the same time .
the supply would be from our own , after conflict , government .
this is the kind of my hometown of my hometown of new orleans .
the military has it , they call the climate change a <unk> , which is security and stability as governments in the world , as to react .
it allows you to be more productive so that they can afford the insurance insurance .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions , if we feel able to make a <unk> world for a world &apos;s livable .
listen like chinese students in english , they listen to english , they &apos;re screaming .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that includes things like the concrete world with <unk> <unk> , to try and to make sense of things that we &apos;re going to take the hypothetical serious , so we &apos;re more asking ourselves what might be as what is .
luria was a mathematician before they <unk> into the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a taxonomy of the concrete world .
and said luria : &quot; the north pole is always snow .
they chose <unk> instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively demanding professions .
would they be being killed , it &apos;s being killed ? &quot;
you might say , a half of times .
it feels like i &apos;ve landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and she <unk> me to do something like a degree .
he &apos;s still in the red figures , but chris managed to be able to do with personal sacrifice , that film <unk> .
i &apos;m a <unk> of her .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> and a <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : &quot; the <unk> is serious .
we were all furious to them , &quot; why are you doing that ?
that &apos;s going to read it , you know it . &quot;
we &apos;ve been working on the game after weeks after weeks , about seven weeks , and we basically had all 50 <unk> into <unk> .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people who was going to jobs for jobs and <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s like its own little connection .
if i had all the three legs of it , in the three legs , in the three legs , i would get a <unk> .
so everything you do is -- it &apos;s a very <unk> case -- that old <unk> , and that old plastic , and this <unk> <unk> is very just in an old <unk> .
that &apos;s possible , if you have a whole piece of paper , <unk> <unk> paper -- you can be in a <unk> school or a <unk> -- a a a a ruler and a pen , a pen , no glue , no glue , no <unk> .
what we do is a very simple <unk> .
this is a little tube , which you do is , these two corners here is <unk> , it &apos;s like a <unk> .
here are two magnets .
it was very much of passengers on the ship , and you were bored , so the captain was going to be the deck of them .
in the <unk> conference , <unk> gupta , <unk> gupta , and intriguing plans to turn waste into really <unk> , so that kids can build themselves -- while they can build the basic principles of science and the design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that provided a lot of evidence .
and there are a few examples of projects that are trying to mimic the ecosystems .
and with a little bit , we can turn a place of the traffic , and the open room for people who put people together with food and waste into the opportunities .
this photograph was taken on the day of it , and it &apos;s a year later , it looked like this .
when you <unk> water , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to explore the people of souls with visions of <unk> . &quot;
i was looking for someone who &apos;s the person , because i &apos;m in the , and i &apos;m in the very important .
but the real thing was , there was a lot of men who were going to do with me .
very few of us have the capacity to be absolutely honest with itself .
he &apos;s like long as it &apos;s not on a <unk> .
i tried to be in principle , as <unk> .
because you remember my <unk> , you have to reach a <unk> of 700 points , and nobody did this .
most of you , <unk> are 33 years old , not eight years , and if we look at the <unk> demographics of the <unk> , the <unk> of the elderly adults .
imagine that vision is very , very good .
these <unk> have even many other benefits in terms of attention , and a sense of attention that is also improved , is our ability to track objects in our environments .
i want to ask you to get to remember this conclusion , and to put it into the context of a different group of <unk> , a group which is actually looking at in our society is being at the people who are the multimedia-tasking .
so let me this step with a piece of mental rotation .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just let all kinds of things in particular case , we &apos;re going to walk .
so it was a big , very complex project that i &apos;m sure is it &apos;s going to work at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and many things .
on the one hand we have mathematica , with its kind of elaborate , <unk> language and a large network of <unk> developed capacity , capable of getting a lot of the <unk> .
so with physical <unk> , we &apos;re kind used to to go to the world and realize that certain materials make sense of useful for certain technology and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited about discovery that these are candidates with incredibly simple rules that has a special theory of relativity , and the general theory and gravity and at least evidence on quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and while that time , i actually lost more , and teachers , who <unk> me , for hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothing .
there was my mother a woman , she didn &apos;t have a relatively property , and automatically owned anything that my family owned , my father , so he had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony we were excited , and i was going to slept all night .
he was sitting in my sneakers , and that had &apos;t even <unk> roads , and it was very handsome .
i promised him to be a girl girl , and i would come back and do everything that they would take me for me .
if it was pregnant in front of marriage , the mother was made for him and <unk> .
while we speak here , 125 girls will never be female again .
consumers , the 72 percent of the american gdp , actually actually , exactly like banks and companies to <unk> their <unk> , in everyday life , even from obligations and risk that we face us when we move forward forward .
and what you &apos;re here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually actually <unk> and in the principle future education , the future children of our homes .
<unk> are up to 48 percent , which is called the survey of the highway .
we also see a trend into something like <unk> tourism . right ?
one of them is the <unk> of community and neighborhood , and more than the neighbors of neighbors .
we also see a big <unk> .
the trend is immense .
then we &apos;re going to take the phenomenon of <unk> .
and then i got the question , i &apos;m the only one that does this ?
you could exploit them .
that &apos;s what i do in my life -- stories , writing novels , and today , i want to share with you some stories about the art of storytelling , and also some of some of man-made creatures , the <unk> .
our <unk> could disintegrate . our hearts could be stunted , and our <unk> might be <unk> , if we &apos;re in a long time in our cultural cultural lives .
and i first came to the first time i call it , &quot; independent of a . &quot;
i &apos;m not a <unk> , no <unk> , or <unk> . i &apos;m asked to why i do that , but the way that i was doing is to reinvent myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story was a huge thing , because i was <unk> .
literature has to take us on the other side .
i could <unk> a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe the will write a happy story , and in my next book , i write maybe about a <unk> , <unk> professor in norway .
so you &apos;re doing this . you &apos;re already taking the existing songs , they cut pieces of pieces , mix these pieces together , and you get a new song , but this new song is clearly made of old songs .
instead , these laws and laws are more awkward compared to the property .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;ll summarize what it touches . <unk> alarm : the <unk> of the telephone , by a symbol of your finger .
our creativity depends from the outside , not from the inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but what you can do you , because then you can recognize your address ? &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper . &quot;
what &apos;s beautiful , you can see the limb there , a kind of <unk> <unk> that &apos;s coming from the limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now this led to a understanding of the atomic structure because it &apos;s so <unk> that atoms have a single core , with <unk> that orbit it .
this image shows a galaxy , a <unk> , , you know , 100 billion stars like the sun .
i think it can also be the <unk> ideas for us to go across our place in the universe and the value of our home .
this is here . it &apos;s home . that &apos;s what we &apos;re .
and with each click and every click and every click and every click of the screen , we &apos;re going to leave and <unk> our personal information all over the way through the digital forests .
and when our daughter sat down on the <unk> , i asked her , &quot; will you get a lot of value on your school . &quot;
we can &apos;t even <unk> this with <unk> <unk> .
well , i want to take you to this journey .
and because i &apos;m a lot of arguing , and i was talking to my <unk> birthday i would not talk more about a day -- a day .
and they don &apos;t talk ...
and i explained to a friend who i realized that i was john , i was that i was going to live through my life , i didn &apos;t talk about that this last time someone would be mine in my sign .
well , i think , i think , i think , <unk> my backpack .
i started talking to speak , because i &apos;ve been studying .
but the <unk> was that i did to take me on every birthday about my silence , but never about my decision , just to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found small jobs in exchange for food .
i was constantly worried that i would be sent to be back back again .
i felt so powerless , because i had so <unk> in america , but my father died of starvation .
but i believe that their gesture of love and gloom , and the lives of a different joseph can change and can get thousands of other <unk> , who still have hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials to building buildings , but this was a lot stronger than i expected to waterproof and make it a little waterproof <unk> .
but then i was very disappointed with my profession as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , the government , contractors .
and then in the next year , in 1995 , there was a big earthquake in japan in japan .
so , i wonder , what is a <unk> and what a <unk> building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we &apos;re learning some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , still in the womb .
so , in fact , fetuses are in the particular language that &apos;s talked about the world in being born in .
it creates a mixture of influences that are so individually and strange , like the woman itself .
why should malnutrition lead to <unk> disease in the womb ?
you can also see a <unk> but also .
this is actually , in the <unk> system for any kind of <unk> .
the audience will be on <unk> <unk> , which are very counterintuitive , but not what happens in front of their eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , you may actually get us to smile .
you may remember , as a <unk> <unk> , okay , and then when the biggest deal of all was announced .
if you &apos;re a high animal at a unesco and a guy , &quot; what do you actually do for the eliminating hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an ad campaign ?
so this is actually a strategy , and i don &apos;t argue that strategy is a role .
for me , all of the music was .
now , when i use this software , the camera sees the <unk> , and i &apos;ll see the location in the way to the <unk> , and you &apos;ve got a whiteboard .
i remember the poor people needed to <unk> -- eating clothing , <unk> , housing -- what they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a <unk> of shame .
now , i heard him , i was excited for various reasons .
i was not a lot of a donation to do , which is usually my way .
it &apos;s about the <unk> of the history of the poor and it &apos;s about giving us a chance to get to , what would say a partnership , not one which is based on a traditional type of donation , can be <unk> .
it &apos;s a very <unk> combination , a very strong combination .
now , it &apos;s a very <unk> at the beginning , and it &apos;s palpable to me , to me , it &apos;s just a vehicle , just a tool .
what is the future of humanity ?
now i &apos;m turning to leave the second big question : are we alone , or there are other life in the universe ?
the answer to these big questions show that we &apos;ve made considerable progress in the last hundred years .
see this here .
here &apos;s photos of me .
and the rate is doubling all 18 months and every <unk> member of the <unk> knows , which is the <unk> law .
but what is to you ? what will it do with you ?
they sail in their saucers across the sky and occasionally , they hired people for experiments that their parents wouldn &apos;t agree with .
so we &apos;re interested in things like this .
now , generations , generations couldn &apos;t do this experiments at all .
and i found that the first technology was coming in a form of <unk> million years ago .
we can learn a lot of them .
and i see <unk> and try to protect my child , because with a child , you don &apos;t leave anyone to a minister of myself .
and second , they say that they had a <unk> gang , but some of the <unk> of the trees .
until now , our know , our ancestors , our ancestors , in the principle of adult individuals , there , the fossils , the <unk> , the ones , the ones .
the <unk> <unk> study is the origin of humanity in the countryside , and he talks about how he found the earliest skeleton of a humanoid child , and what we can learn in africa .
and if all of the rules should be , of course , an effective system for reasoning and <unk> , as we &apos;ve seen , in fact , trust is also necessary .
it &apos;s looking at as high seas because the continent is <unk> by <unk> .
we need to work locally , but also an <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol <unk> says , &quot; i would pay numbers to do what i do . &quot;
that was a very good idea .
to clear to say , i &apos;m a journalist , not a technologist , so i want to design a sketch , so i want to design a sketch , like the present and the future .
and finally , i think we have to think of whether we all think that that will be our reality -- and if what it means for our idea of life and for everything that comes after .
it looks like crude oil .
the the complex of the complex is that you have the strong and <unk> , the right solution , doesn &apos;t matter how difficult the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write an article for the new york times , and to explain how it works .
of course we can .
and they earn a lot of money .
it &apos;s the one for instance , higher than the american american american .
we &apos;ll try to try and probably go wrong .
<unk> immediately . &quot;
and <unk> was always trying to do it , but he could never prove the guess .
i think that our approach is simply not sustainable .
china wants to have achieved this in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even even slow down .
the future is naturally <unk> .
yes , it will be ugly , and yes , it &apos;s going to be a lot of time -- in the age of security in our lifespan -- but we &apos;re more than to overcome everything that comes on us .
and here &apos;s where you get in .
and what we need to think about is this : if you get up in flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we believed we can lay this debt to our children , but it &apos;s about to you .
everything is <unk> .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
students , what stage is the cell is the cell .
that should be an amazing thing right ?
everything we get is <unk> .
you will be able to focus on your listening to the gravitational scale or a range of things that we can &apos;t do .
that &apos;s not a thousand years in the distance .

of course , there &apos;s the internet for more than 5,000 days -- the web is just 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine we &apos;re now a <unk> , a human brain if we look at the rate that grows , in 30 years , it &apos;s six billion <unk> .
now it &apos;s not so -- if you &apos;re a spreadsheet and things that you &apos;re doing a word , you &apos;re not part of the web , but they will be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people are going to be the <unk> senses of machine . &quot; in a sense .

and to get back to our exponential growth of computing : 1,000 dollars on computation is about the brain of an insect or a mouse .
and in <unk> , we will reach the full <unk> of these trends , and they have to celebrate how often that put together in the form of technology -- faster and faster when we get to this point .
they can play and <unk> .

and you know what ?
and who are the largest <unk> ?
it &apos;s very grim .
our thinking is backwards .

rg + <unk> : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s such a episode of &quot; star trek . &quot;

imagine , big , you know , the dead <unk> of the time , you would play , and john <unk> walker shows how footage can be analyzed and analyze the exact <unk> and analyze it , then they can analyze it on <unk> wings .
well , since we have a time of remarkable economic growth , and it &apos;s the longest recovery in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , as well politicians , as good politicians , &quot; in the apple apple would bite you without the face of <unk> , &quot; as someone put in , you can &apos;t hide your uncertainty yet .
now , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , a back , lightly , messy man who was eating <unk> and pulled back to iron .

now , this is a <unk> theory .
now you please put this device so she can be able to measure your sneakers , so i can measure your <unk> .
it &apos;s the current pleasure in the future of pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the capacity to communicate across generations .
we teachers teachers are constantly .

at the same time , i was in the field of the <unk> , although i was a <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
people and <unk> and and and birds , and everything that are going up here , and these are people , livestock and pets .
we &apos;re focused on serious <unk> of the future and produced products for the company .

the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re all out . we take the feeling of a mother and long that all creatures in this meditation .
and you think about how <unk> things are , if they &apos;re happy , if they &apos;re happy .
and of course they are cruel and more vulnerable to others .
although the change in your attitudes are something for other beings , and they feel this new quality in you , and it &apos;s helping you already , and they &apos;re for a model .
so the coffee cup is , or the cup of dealing with a handle one of the society , using the public health .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very simple when you know how to read it .
well , let me close to four <unk> remarks , an example and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to stop with the details , but in the bottom right corner , you see what we have for .

that costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to devote their altruistic to someone and actually , a team , it was done , between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing that i thought was to thank him for for .
but the truth is that life is just going on .
so the people call people to and have messages like this one .
he said , &quot; i am like batman to do my anonymity . &quot;
and the one who has no data , so that she turned out that she pulled in a different town and had a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the foundation of everything , from the parts of <unk> , dopamine and things , to the <unk> .
and some of you have it . and it &apos;s about the sex .
this was one of those cases , because there was no force under their ancestors , but in my father .
they &apos;re so similar to each other , as you can be .
by the way , i have an email tomorrow , which is that we &apos;ve completed the last part of atlas .
and these guys are the weak force that might be least known .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or so that <unk> tie them , you should be able to have a <unk> computer -- why dna has the shape that you &apos;ve now got to have ...
the comparison is that the people in this room represent the higgs particles .
but it &apos;s really so that with this theory of the physical <unk> of the big bang , and there &apos;s absolutely wonderful prediction . the model has not made with the goal that it seems to do it .
they made this civilization , this wonderful image , which has converted it into light and it enables that to see the civilization from the space .
another great insight came from a study of <unk> state university in 2010 , the baseball maps of the <unk> players looked at the <unk> of the <unk> years .
in a similar study in germany , researchers in an archaeological <unk> to measure <unk> and after her <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
&quot; because the colors that you have to order not to the european standard , &quot; he would be .
&quot; huh ? why ? are here more police officers are deployed ? &quot;
we built the light <unk> that people who were given to the people who were to think they were traveling abroad , to <unk> their cause .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe you can do something , and you &apos;ve done it half . &quot;
all in port-au-prince came entrepreneurs and offering offering <unk> for mobile phones .
a theme for the potential of the technology is happening in kibera .
by 2015 , there are three billion smartphones to the world .
in the shops of the environment , the batteries and bread .
this is a lot of that flow of time in everything , in the erosion of a <unk> , in the <unk> , the <unk> rose .
do you read an interview with a writer ?
and as i , when i look at the big bear , i remember , as a kid in his head , not by his shoulders , and i feel like this kid .
we &apos;ve seen again , how creative technology can be and in our lives and our do , we can choose those solutions , innovation and moments , the the flow of time not <unk> , but again .
my mother was <unk> .
in every single refugee , they had to <unk> soldiers , the my older brother mark , who was nine , take away from him to child child child .
and i should do it alone .
take anything that you want to have out of the suitcase .
and then i ended up in <unk> , because i don &apos;t get my emotions .
thank you .
almost all life on earth is going to be wiped out five times .
<unk> <unk> has the answer .
why should that play a role ?
so , in fact , we can grow any organ from any cell .
here &apos;s the rise in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the bottom line .
so , when the moves moves with the same speed , the robot is .
and you can see how is the control .
and he does that , while he <unk> obstacles .
they take your neighbors .
this is what we &apos;re showing the <unk> double , 100 , 100 times more times , in which we bring them to make teams as you can see here .
but the robot can find out alone where he wants to go .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so many and i want to expand your horizon , and you &apos;re looking to the mind and change your view of honeybees .
that &apos;s a huge problem for many years , which is basically a problem in which is basically the in the late 1980s , which many different viruses , bacteria and <unk> .
you don &apos;t see it .
the chefs take the chefs to vote for their dishes , and the honey -- they use the honey on their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees are dying , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now , now , the question is : why is this ?
of course , we also have , especially in the last decade , the world with a dense chain of <unk> to a chain of global trade .
and never before , many people were not aware of this .
in fact , not many of you that our bread was not the european invention .
and especially <unk> in <unk> and china , and china drives the <unk> .
<unk> has been most people , and there are not many farmers to be bad for them to be bad , the environment , to be , in great scale , to destroy the environment .
everything together .
and while i &apos;m finished doing my bread -- and i &apos;m going to <unk> it . and i &apos;m trying to burn the hands .
and also , it has to be able to keep the long time with the tools that we can use materials and <unk> .
you take someone like me , a scientist , analyzed and you know , and we developed a new technology , and it &apos;s what the quantitative <unk> <unk> .
because i hope you &apos;re going to take this from here today , a new connection with nature .
this was a couple of days ago in <unk> .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
that &apos;s about the last year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them . and shekhar kapur , you got a film about you , <unk> queen , who should you see .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is actually <unk> <unk> than <unk> .
this is a <unk> patient who was in the time , it was a <unk> , but it was decided to do this .
i like this slide because you can talk to you about what people really motivated to change , and what &apos;s not .
if you eat a meal meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . americans , even more fat because the , and even more of the means , so the percentage are lower , but the actual number are lower , but the actual number are , the goal is to reduce both .
one of the most <unk> <unk> studies found that 70 percent of the people were being <unk> , 65 percent of people had bad breath , <unk> , headaches -- that &apos;s not healthy food .
on the other hand , everything creates intimacy , is <unk> .
i hope it doesn &apos;t stand on .
the film is based on a <unk> of scott <unk> .
two <unk> were involved in the project : warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had enough passion to make the <unk> and technology .
we so we prospered from motion .
the number of being just seemed to be infinite .
and that &apos;s the data that we get it , and then the the model for the model .
and this was what the finished picture was used in the film .
it was a very , very , very early rehearsal .
and we found this , in the state of karnataka .
and it has a <unk> .
the people of <unk> are going to keep these <unk> , <unk> past , in their lives .
we were to <unk> -- two of them as a rider -- and imagine , this is a ocean from sand , 40 degrees fahrenheit , one water bottle .
i think the camel is the best <unk> animal in the world . &quot;
and they use it as much as we see our <unk> .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;ll show you another film .
i don &apos;t <unk> , until my body temperature 40 to 40 or <unk> , enough to get an egg in a <unk> .
<unk> , thank you for inviting me .
start a meeting with a poem , and that &apos;s an idea .
but how would you like it , if you never knew how to do the next day you like a living god <unk> , their shoulders in the clouds , or if you sit down there , the tray of the tray just hanging out of their little <unk> ?
who could sleep quiet ?
but you knew that judy <unk> in your age , 150,000 dollars a film that <unk> d <unk> the french army led to <unk> and blaise pascal his room -- no wait , i mean he invented the calculator ?
at the end , she sat in a tree , and one hand adds up to the other .
and the human <unk> is more than that , but would you take those two columns , probably probably not much left .
and then we have the problem with elephants , that you can &apos;t build construction , which would be a very hard for an <unk> .
one component is that understanding . here is a <unk> , &quot; the ability to understand the feelings of the other and to share . &quot;
so now , we &apos;re looking at more complex expressions . here &apos;s comfort .
the test doesn &apos;t look at it .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you have to do .
a philosopher wrote , we realized that , that means that monkeys had a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the french french revolution .
now , it &apos;s not a lonely crazy , there &apos;s not two crazy kooks , three is a lot of power and lots of power .
the last decade i &apos;ve spent on this , pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good thing , the <unk> .
and i have to say , thank god .
so i stopped , in a way , it was a success .
over the years , the <unk> can create severe .
a.j. jacobs : how the healthy life has me almost like to
and i think many of the <unk> of the vision .
really cool thing .
now these studies are valid scientifically , and they were <unk> <unk> , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask the part of the story that &apos;s not telling .
a priest ?
but the last one group , who believes the indus people are the ancestors of the people in today today .
on the right to the left , how many ? okay .
it can be useful in the <unk> , more data that are <unk> .
and this sign is the number one of the indus script , and just in this text , it seems to double .
it turns out that it &apos;s a long tradition of the ground on the foundation of <unk> at the time of the <unk> at the time of the <unk> at the time .
space , we all know what it looks like .
this wire <unk> the <unk> that would the name bell .
and , jansky had made the historical discovery that the molecules can be as as as <unk> waves can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
actually , all the young people in the city .
somebody who sits in the seat , which is fine in a <unk> , but you &apos;d sit on a <unk> and someone would sit so close to you , then they would <unk> .
the dalai lama would like to say -- he says , if you get in your mind , you get in the idea of the <unk> , it &apos;s because you realize that you yourself and fearless of the pain and joys of it a little <unk> for your intelligence .
but take this wonderful thing that has made us , and they hunt us a bit of the <unk> .
a man in front of a tank , an image that became a symbol of resisting .
but what if you didn &apos;t have to do anything if they had modern communications , to create a sense that was wrong that was wrong , right ?
combine the power of a global ethic that is to communicate with global level and to organize global level , with the challenges that are us now and the most of global nature .
in the museum of kids in rwanda , there &apos;s a photo of a <unk> boy -- and the museum of the children who were left , as the <unk> of the <unk> of rwanda had died in .
here &apos;s the task : help me to build a vibrant , <unk> <unk> in 3d .
they can move on very different <unk> -- they vary in the <unk> , the movement of the surface and the bottom .
and the here is <unk> to the driving algae .
boy : <unk> .
we slow to see the spikes in action .
mark cutkosky , one of my partner , is an extraordinary engineer , which is a technique called <unk> deposition manufacturing , where he &apos;s putting them directly into a artificial foot .
you &apos;re almost like <unk> , and the secret , what they stick stick , their toes toes .
so here we draw the wheel .
these <unk> structure allow it to be the spines , <unk> and the <unk> , to capture a very <unk> , difficult surfaces .
so , <unk> long long <unk> of <unk> , who are serving as a <unk> and males as a female enable the female choices to find each other and choose a partner .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet away , they have to be less than half the time the whistles .
if we think of animals as dolphins , we have to think about the implications of our interventions that we were quite harmless .
after the <unk> , the marine <unk> has made these systems available to learn what scientists could hear .
they just hear the low frequencies .
when males and females , that signal , and they &apos;re using a <unk> and they find a partner and they &apos;re spread , imagine what causes the impact of the population of the population .
how ships can be made . they found that with a better <unk> <unk> of that noise that can be reduced 90 percent .
it &apos;s the speed for 50 percent .
we see disgust worlds , we see strangers , 300 times , and it &apos;ll always be more . and they &apos;re not like us .
you &apos;ve got all the opportunity to .
we &apos;re seeing a continual rise to men .
and obviously , there &apos;s one of the hundred .
with initiatives like the 100 dollars , it &apos;s me to wonder that we can bring a whole new generation of people into the old <unk> computers .
thank you .
i think nothing is the problem .
our daily lives , but , <unk> said , in a remarkable state , we &apos;re saying in a <unk> .
normally , it &apos;s a or two a year .
and there &apos;s it !
but we &apos;re a lot of big .
part of the challenge was to try and rhythm and space by <unk> , by the rhythm , you &apos;re a lot of <unk> -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet , and the balls with my feet .
and then they play crazy .
ok , because you all don &apos;t understand what a <unk> is , i give you a little hint of reference .
now , again , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .

if i run this pink sound for a few minutes , would literally stop listening to it .
many people get to headphone abuse , but that transform big , public spaces like this , multiple <unk> , in millions of tiny personal <unk> .
you can do that in a beautiful place , like a lake .
and finally , the acronym .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s my job . &quot;
thank you very much that you guys are so grateful .

that &apos;s something that we can work in our lifetime , i believed it can take a difference and i tried to get out of the <unk> , to come into the <unk> .
but sometimes science has some other features that really really do interesting .
what do we get more data ?
there &apos;s something that we think it is obviously , but wrong .
it &apos;s so that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the alligator as a very clever , not in a human .
in humans , we &apos;ve developed the most part of the <unk> , with the name of the neocortex , which nature has this little trick .
it &apos;s not so that you can see , and say , &quot; what &apos;s i see now ?
not like a <unk> . not exactly the slightest like a <unk> .

the computer , and in one of three subjects .
if you think , you think differently than the employer of the united states , which actually was part of our <unk> , because exactly what we did .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but a delay is a delay between the enlightenment , how we deal with the data and the actual beginning of the <unk> .
the price of it is displacement from paradise .
and they moved and 600,000 themselves and they left their arms up to each other and <unk> .
we &apos;re really good at the skills to talk about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad to talk about character .

they need their empathy .
lexicography : the process of being in .
well , first of all , i blame the queen because it &apos;s funny .
online dictionaries have to be different .
the bad words -- you see , if someone thinks about a place , and then you don &apos;t think it &apos;s on the map , then he thinks , &quot; this card sucks ! &quot;
you think , &quot; ok , if we &apos;re concerned that words that we use to give our thoughts , to make our thoughts , where should you know that , are better than hammer ?
the <unk> has 33 different sets of definitions for &quot; the &quot;
and then there &apos;s that mike <unk> . mike <unk> lives in the u.k.
i have the whole time , &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , &quot; the dictionary . &quot;
so , i get a chair .
and to make a long story short , here &apos;s i landed .
and so , in order , in this three days , as this three days , you start to understand , &quot; why am i going to hear all this stuff of this stuff on ?
you may be from a ted speaker and so we can come back the conversation during the year , and next year , after the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers don &apos;t have implemented the <unk> in their cheap cheap <unk> , because they &apos;re not sure what the public would start to do so precise , which actually fold in the palm of the palm of the hands .
and there was unsure that that was already <unk> , and it was actually not able to find the the shark .
instead of <unk> the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be you .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves <unk> &amp; amp ; we call and we &apos;re in india in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this is a work of a <unk> people .
we &apos;re arguing about the case , &quot; what the world needs now , is nuclear , &quot; right ? right ?
and now , there &apos;s only three <unk> of it -- coal and gas , <unk> , which is the almost everywhere -- and nuclear .
we &apos;ve become the russian warheads that &apos;s turned into it into electricity .
<unk> emissions are equivalent emissions and particles , the warming , and to expand co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons with the proliferation , with the proliferation , because we know that india and pakistan secretly secretly <unk> nuclear weapons through <unk> <unk> .
for wind energy , the land is much larger , but the <unk> is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support support of cultures -- just one or two voices to the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get from renewables from renewable sources .
i used to worry about the 10,000 years .
thank you .
that was -- my motivation was covered by apollo .

26 groups of seven countries , they were the competition , every one of a and 25 million dollars .
<unk> -- we can bring them to the space station .
and the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> and the social <unk> .
would you surprise us , i &apos;m going to be excited about this ?
that means that surfaces themselves can make themselves . they can be incredibly small .
a challenge was , how we can express this new algorithmic order to a column .
what i didn &apos;t know about time because we only saw the outside , that the area farther down , in the column , which was a pretty surprising discovery .
so inspired by the process of cell division , michael <unk> algorithms , the incredible , fascinating forms of millions of areas . no human could create it by hand , but you can build them , and you could make our understanding of architecture .
so , look at this image here -- lots of pieces , dancing here for them .
it &apos;s a very rare disease .
this is a drug that &apos;s developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip actually <unk> the <unk> .
it &apos;s a very young nation that will be led by young people .
and i think there are many people in the room , many of them are in the same position as i .
so i think women are being in leaders in our society because they recognize that it &apos;s important to their future generations , and to get our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve realized that for the past , more people like youtube and social networks to give their stories expression , and to show their stories and their stories and their own their own voices .
at the same time , we store them , and we &apos;ll find our part of the world .
so i was more or less than it &apos;s been .
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i make these ants a couple of apartments , you pull it . &quot;
this was called &quot; <unk> house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i got back to the next day .
and it went ...
my work , roughly , sometimes five , six or seven weeks ; that &apos;s not you can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i took it around , and shaped it shaped the <unk> .
so i lay the needle .
it &apos;s a very <unk> work , but the best things come in small <unk> .
they expect to their employees , they &apos;re asked to have what they &apos;ve been doing to do , if they &apos;ve been doing the task , you can do extra .
there &apos;s this total concentration , that absolute psychic of consciousness , consciousness , a perfect heart of compassion and love that the primary heart of divine .
my <unk> body flew into the one , my <unk> bike into the other .
i did all the <unk> that i probably won &apos;t do with you , the <unk> that i wouldn &apos;t have to go out of , the friends that would you would not look at you , the <unk> that i couldn &apos;t go with you .
because you don &apos;t need the <unk> .
and if you go from you from the back , against the wind , you can just get it over and it makes <unk> <unk> in the dirt . &quot;
20 years ago , the doctors would have taken my leg , and i was hoping , and there was a 15 <unk> of survival .
as i became more and more human -- and at that point in my life , i was probably 14 pounds easier than i &apos;m now .
and no one <unk> that modern <unk> , more than david black .
walking upright , you &apos;ll say the door is what makes us human .
he &apos;s president of the international coalition for <unk> , which is the least <unk> name i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born and a half months to a half months , and it was really a fantastic <unk> of him .
so as soon as i tried to approach the piano , i was a powerful <unk> .
and the end of was , you were so fast that things like the bumblebee &quot; the &quot; flight of the bumblebee &quot; were not a problem , right ?
would you like to hear me ?
dp : &quot; tiger <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t <unk> that .
they &apos;re struggling to do their own way in this forest in a world that is still clean , a world which don &apos;t have been covered in a world that &apos;s not covered .
we know , we know that they can be able to achieve that the research has been in the basis of absolutely impossible .
it was a very hard to <unk> with a mother , who was developing , and the siblings , the siblings , the whole life can be kept alive and that can be 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge camp of the <unk> forest is now , and so that the pygmies that fell in the <unk> and so many years of living that were in the <unk> and many years of living in their wonderful lifestyle , spoil .
yesterday , one said that one .
we now have to do in every state , and the problems in florida are others than the in new york .
are you going to get me down here ?
there &apos;s the way out there ?
what we want to do in the lab is so much the same thing , but with a few dozen of different types of molecules -- that &apos;s a <unk> reduction in complexity , but yet the attempt to create something more .
it &apos;s even very <unk> . if you &apos;re acting , it doesn &apos;t really do something .
now , where you &apos;re all the experts for protocells , we are play with these protocells play a game .
we then see the self-assembly of this body , which we saw before , and the black blob of these black blob in the , very complex , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , which is how living cells -- and its work shows how life could be done at the earth first ... and perhaps somewhere else .
this is a <unk> <unk> to take your tadpole for a walk .
what is that -- where did you know that ? they &apos;ve taken it .
but if we were that in every one -- everyone fire fire , we could redefine the emergency .
that &apos;s filth , which is <unk> , which is otherwise in her pretty pink lungs , and that &apos;s going to be .
the birds could jump from one to the other .
you can talk about the news of him , and you can talk to him .
but it &apos;s going to demand a great toll of our planet .
and then , when we put skin cells , and multiply it in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working for thousands of years , with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we do all the time on the world we project , we see that there are almost a universal pursuit of people to have a car .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
that is a huge energy molecule to generate mobile energy .
if we can see these <unk> future , the other one .
you had to survive .
and we certainly made to be our school district , and we found , and get support and support .
because why should our students be so far away from their lives ?
it was a book to a book , then to a demo .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here on the west coast , they <unk> their forest .
but on this image , you see how we started building the <unk> , which was a big active active in brazil .
and when i came to my <unk> , i &apos;ve studied the new <unk> subject of the <unk> .
if you zoom in the south <unk> , you can see the expansion of new york city like it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are the <unk> of places .
or the <unk> , the <unk> meadows , insects and <unk> places .
maybe there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> there .
it &apos;s so much force in , science and visual interaction that are these pictures , and it &apos;s like both sides of the <unk> .
and we &apos;re now a really dramatic level of that right now .
so i don &apos;t have to go into it .
you can make the pristine , which is to stay .
this is a <unk> building .
one example that we all know is this is the cell phones . right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course , in a very artistic and <unk> way .
but it &apos;s all everywhere , and these tools are bits of them that help us to do it .
seriously -- clap them quietly -- this is real great .
alex <unk> : a sustainable future
you could think that a big problem for a law , but that doesn &apos;t seem to be very much to <unk> .
but if you put a lot of internal copies and sold , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we made from things that we found and every single one , and they causes the terror in this industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very elitist , <unk> , <unk> education in india , and it &apos;s made me almost sealed .
and i thought , i &apos;m going to invite a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional person is somebody who &apos;s a combination of competence , confidence and conviction .
and when i said that , they said , &quot; show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?
the whole power comes from the sun .
democracy , <unk> , how to be the country , what you should do , if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do in case an animal is ill .
come in there to the tensions , the attendance in the schools , is it between teachers and parents , so the puppet that the teacher would call the and say , &quot; give you the hands .
you use sign sign sign .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
a <unk> .
and our <unk> are one of the biggest , dynamically <unk> computers in the world for this kind of <unk> .
and you see here the <unk> along the <unk> , which we created as an artist for scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there &apos;s data data from people , data , and they &apos;re happy to be happy .
&quot; i &apos;m going to be more , financially , financially , mentally , mentally , mentally , mentally , mentally , mentally , in almost every other way , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t have a minute .
he <unk> it , and of course , he was not <unk> , and he was ray <unk> six months later , right .
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re in the experiment that i &apos;ve been using , <unk> prints prints .
we collected together , we went out of the room and waiting half an hour .
i &apos;ll show you why .
they were two pictures , and they had two beautiful <unk> , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> of these things for them , and we said , &quot; what would you ? &quot;
we take a whole new group of <unk> <unk> and say , &quot; you know , we give a <unk> , and we can make it in two different ways .
<unk> that the big car and the <unk> fly is beautiful .
voices : it flies in the air . oh shit .
&quot; mama , don &apos;t start . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition doesn &apos;t come from the <unk> of <unk> , but it goes back in a time before we <unk> stories on <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the kind of food , yeah .
the kind of the <unk> roof , you know .
and so we left my father , because i knew he would kill me if i let them go to let me go to the car . so we get into the car .
&quot; and had this guy a blue uniform on a blue , and a <unk> expression on the face ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to do that in ? because if i don &apos;t thread , i &apos;m not <unk> <unk> to <unk> , and i could be <unk> for your taste ? — — could be that i never come out .
see ? we &apos;re a secret nuclear club .
she says , &quot; mama , you have to look ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m a voice for the little old lady , furious , damn damn time ! &quot;
it &apos;s up from the car . &quot;
i really fear very fear .
so what is the social result of it ?
where can i go and and with who ?
and if we have it , we will decide how many kilometers we drive , where the <unk> , where we live and work .
now you &apos;re communicating with a <unk> of the station , and you can see exactly where your bus is on the way , and when it comes , and you can buy your tickets in real time .
i want to start the wireless <unk> <unk> , and i challenge that this network should be <unk> standards for everyone .
and they came in the late 1960s .
and for all of you who came to a mental illness , knowing what can be a challenge .
i said that i wanted to tell the <unk> , i wanted to leave you to share with you the three a <unk> of the world , and i wanted to leave you with a <unk> .
because they all were three years old .
and what i love about this story is that rosey grier is just a authentic authentic person , and that &apos;s why authenticity is about authenticity .
i ate <unk> with <unk> . &quot;
you &apos;re sleeping in a clean <unk> .
j it &apos;s so many that &apos;s the problem has become the problem .
and i found it strange to speculate about it was a competition that &apos;s a kind of fresh .
it was largely a white , rich <unk> , which was not the first of the city .
it looks pretty simple , but it was a <unk> .
the people who were about two things -- they were astonished by the destruction , but there was a sense of the <unk> over the <unk> of the new yorker that i found very moving .
because at all the four platforms along the <unk> , where we have a <unk> version of a <unk> -- we knew that it had to be , it was <unk> , to respond to a <unk> conditions and the changed definition of ground zero .
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : it was a honor for me .
and i know that children suffer every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody forbid , somebody from us here and a concussion , that would most of us in a period of hours to a few weeks from a few weeks .
they have to be familiar with the problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
as it turned out , tom saw , a helmet was a helmet for 20 dollars , a good opportunity to keep a 100,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s not true , but it happened to tony blair during the 1930s , of course , he was discovered , &quot; discovered , &quot; was discovered and it &apos;s described .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that &apos;s in <unk> sequence .
he was told that there was no cure .
today , all countries are committed to provide patents for drugs that were at least 20 years .
it depends on the <unk> of the company , to harness their patents and to make them for others .
in orlando , the same stage , a <unk> , and people were sitting in the slam sun , the afternoon in very high humidity and they didn &apos;t feel .
they can adapt everything to worry for their well-being .
he &apos;s providing all these services , <unk> , and so little things that you &apos;re going to go on , but for people who connects this to the digital world .
the question was , &quot; how do you do in this teacher .
let &apos;s see what he does here .
and the daughter of her daughter , he was also sick by the <unk> of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very big .
now , <unk> had a <unk> of our studies .
well , if we feel emotion , we &apos;ll show them .
and you could get the impression that the unfortunate people will take a different structural position within the network .
that &apos;s my <unk> . &quot;
they are both carbon , and yet one of the two <unk> of <unk> in which are arranged in a particular way on the left , and they get <unk> , the soft and dark .
to take this thing to <unk> , let me pull out for a moment .
and that &apos;s not just easy .
under the same circumstances , older people are taking their cognitive resources , like <unk> and memory , more on positive information than a negative information than negative information .
we &apos;re the life .
and they &apos;d let me , &quot; tonight tonight i &apos;m going to perform this <unk> for this <unk> for this <unk> . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s so that i said , frankly , often not know what happens when i dance .
they &apos;ve been <unk> me and uncle , and over a period of five years , over the time .
<unk> : the second treaty of fort treaty has clearly clearly the sovereignty of the great sioux nation and the <unk> of the lakota of the black hills .
the treaty fort established , that at least three quarter of the <unk> sign to sign to the country .
they were the precursor .
the <unk> is eight times as high as the american average .
so what &apos;s going to us ?
and today ? the child mortality fell since 1960 since 1960 , 24 percent .
you get it either either either either either either either either either , or a syringe , you have to take it every day to regulate the <unk> .
if we &apos;re doing it , like here to people .
but it &apos;s basically a lot of meaning .
she says , are they smarter than a <unk> ?
bmw is a very safe car .
the problem for bmw is , this is safe to look like .
now you &apos;ll think , &quot; if my life depends on it , i would be using it every day . &quot;
we have to connect this with a scientific method .
that &apos;s something else as a really is effective campaign .
which is not new .
the base are going to be dark .
we do it for our customers .
we have the in the sun .
now , logic -- meaning , you can see , you &apos;re now at this position where you get into the right now , without moving the wrist .
i &apos;m going to intervene now now , if every time ... a different person -- not always the same answers .
so , if you &apos;re interested in , i &apos;m going to present some of a couple of <unk> .
here , i have to look at the start looking at my maps as i can follow my maps and the <unk> -- oh , we should have a problem , no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what card should i use ? the queen or five ?
lg : but you can see your hand .
moment , please -- take some card .
another color . lg : lg : lg , perfect .
compassion .
<unk> , yes ? zoe : yeah .
here -- there &apos;s all the cards -- there -- there &apos;s all the cards is right ?
and finally , the king -- in exactly ... five seconds .
some of them seem to know this kid .
after i was back , i was made my entire company to a <unk> . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have your musical ear , you could not turn off on your car .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening .
i always say my students , &quot; if you &apos;ve always always pick up a bug , and then you recognize it . &quot;
imagine that person before and follow it at the same time from h to e , and you will hear everything the chopin had to say .
i was an amazing experience . i was 45 , was a 45 , and i was a a a a a a realization .
she came to auschwitz when she was 15 years old , her brother was eight , her parents lost her .
so ladies and gentlemen of the jury , look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest all of all today , they get 20 dollars . &quot;
for tasks , but the 21st century works , this <unk> , doesn &apos;t work -- often often often do harm .
think about your own work .
the standard of living is lower .
these are the building blocks of a completely new <unk> of our business .
this one day intense autonomy has led to a whole series of <unk> , which maybe maybe never have been given .
do it because you like to do it .
now , it &apos;s used by its light weight .
in a series of 55 spheres is declining to the size , every sphere and their distances are declining to the same way to this small soil .
and the blue side , the <unk> , shows it in the other direction .
this has developed in many <unk> years .
the <unk> on the object , probably a <unk> image of the earth .
but they &apos;re always going to get those 10 percent or more than that most <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> dollars and a club at the <unk> of <unk> dollars .
charitable organizations have to be withdrawn , bold , big engineered new yorkers to try and fear that in failure , you pulled their reputation by the <unk> .
so what should you do ?
the overhead is now .
dan <unk> : our thinking about charity is <unk>
then , there was the <unk> audience , yes , who have this part of the music .
people who made this <unk> , the <unk> , all these beautiful instruments .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m responsible .
it &apos;s just about the terms of music , as it &apos;s written , not about interpretation . &quot;
that &apos;s great . and what is the eyes ?
that &apos;s what he does .
you know , authority is to be , if it &apos;s needed . that &apos;s very important .
kleiber is all about the process .
as a <unk> , we tell us many stories about the future and what steps we could do from here .
there are 98 <unk> nations around the world .
and in the face of climate change , it &apos;s not really <unk> .
and it &apos;s a process that makes really joy .
and they thought about how to push it forward .
and the <unk> said , &quot; if we didn &apos;t have the transition <unk> , we have to invent this whole community of infrastructure for the first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced , and to a certain extent , the games that they play to hide , which is so much that you can &apos;t recognize what the are really very obvious challenges .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really only four states that are not to stand towards this big challenge .
and even if they just get along that , they could push money down there .
it should be more like private accounting .
but i had a <unk> , when i went to <unk> <unk> , and i was in a <unk> in my life , and i tried to decide between music and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
many years after the solar-powered clocks was a young lady who i knew that sex may be so good for the five senses .
the following is , is good sex all the five senses on a extreme level .
of course , the only is the only thing that makes the difference in interesting .
we are all born as artists .
if you have a conversation , the child has to come up with the next to the next to the next to the , which it started .
but their parents tell you , &quot; it will go off all of the waves . &quot;
but kids typically do art . it &apos;s play .
but as a teacher , you can find a lot .
in <unk> , there are people who sing &quot; <unk> &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hotel california , &quot; as they mimic fake fake .
right in this minute , we can turn on the tv off , and they &apos;re out of the internet , and they &apos;re on and start to do something .
the students are in a kind of trance .
he said it &apos;s his profile . &quot; and what are they ? &quot; i asked &quot; &quot; actors , &quot; he said .
let &apos;s start with that , as i came to this point .

we don &apos;t have all the facts . we don &apos;t even know what the tools are going to be , or what we need to look for the only thing that we need to be able to be able to get to get there before the different behavior .
how are you going to grow it ? &quot;
the three are all the same , although they &apos;re all the same in different context , one is magical , which are the other like this books , i like this books because they have something very special about .
the children taught them .
they were very friendly .
we also believe that the most important thing is .
i was changed by my children .
and howard &apos;s doing this experiment and when he &apos;s going to pick up the data , he &apos;s going to see a curve , and suddenly he sees that there &apos;s no beautiful <unk> .
this was his <unk> . he was obsessed with it .
howard doesn &apos;t believe that there are this .
that &apos;s what people who are always , if you ask them , how you want to your coffee .

what &apos;s interesting , once you put it -- and -- -- and by the way -- this is from <unk> -- show all the artifacts of modern comics : <unk> <unk> <unk> simple line line without <unk> and a <unk> from left to the right .
and that was what i suggested , maybe we could make comics do on an infinite canvas on the <unk> and the line and the line and in <unk> .
this is by daniel <unk> <unk> in the u.k.
maybe all of you , i &apos;ve been all right , but for me , so often i had encountered this very hard day , i had never seen this the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the same time .

and how do you do that ?
the <unk> <unk> , the molas , when they come into the bay , you put it into a kind of <unk> , and then it throws around .

goodbye <unk> <unk> .
could i get my last line ?
never , that &apos;s impossible ! no , no , no ! it &apos;s not possible . &quot;
you could see it all the addition .
von neumann , a <unk> and a mathematician from the army brought everything together , and then they needed a room to build them .
the <unk> and it &apos;s a <unk> .

misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group of <unk> politically <unk> hackers the 2011 of 2011 .
the network combines everything and will soon be a lot of human activity .
interestingly , anonymous is <unk> its energy accounts for profit .
he explained to me like he and 2004 , he went in new york tour , took 10,000 dollars from his atm machines , 30,000 dollars from the atm machine using using her cards .
he was born in <unk> in a stable and respect pregnant family , who led to play with play as a teenager led him to the <unk> .
and most of the script , the the script and <unk> , they don &apos;t reveal the social skills in the world world -- just in the net .
i think there &apos;s several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into the details , but some mention .
but they &apos;re all involved in the market , and what the market is is all the big demographic &apos;s big demographic .
we also found a lot of examples of dead big boxes that have been transformed into all sorts of social institutions , many churches , lots of churches , lots of churches , and many libraries , like this .
and finally , i expect the streets will expect by the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it helped motivate that eight by 13 regional <unk> <unk> <unk> plans to be <unk> .
the bach was <unk> by the parking lot .
their population are different than typical <unk> , but they &apos;re less <unk> than cities .
&quot; his vagina to look at , &quot; she said , &quot; is a whole <unk> . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t really started there , with a conversation with a woman .
this is about a gender , which is a basic resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and the way that exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning in our heads -- that this separation has created a division that often the intention of the decision .
i want to tell this little story about my own very beginning , because that &apos;s very with happiness with and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s about my <unk> south carolina , which is not much smaller than today , and once from a future of a younger american country .
well , maybe he was too <unk> , because he remained , even long after the <unk> went through the nazis , and even after the <unk> and <unk> were in budapest .
and he got the same answer : &quot; you get me the best workers who can find them and if you &apos;re good enough , i &apos;ll do it . &quot;
and so clearly , it says , &quot; it &apos;s fine . it was so beautiful .
&quot; ha ! &quot; he said dr. robicsek . &quot; i went to the film . &quot;
like , he &apos;s too much .
and you can imagine yourself .
you know what you &apos;re looking for .
but we care about the hard time and we don &apos;t get to order to buy the next day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia and my mother went , during the time of the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s about , it &apos;s going to get it for so long until you get on .
so what i want to do with this , i hope to illustrate the following .
and what i &apos;d like to point out in the presentation , 50 percent of the united states is under the ocean .
it &apos;s because the photons can &apos;t reach the average depths of the ocean , which is <unk> miles . the <unk> is on <unk> miles .
and so we drove along the <unk> in a field , and then we were there the missing heat .
so i started to develop a new <unk> of <unk> with a <unk> that replaces me , and i have to get to my vehicle .
we find the <unk> of the <unk> .
and i looked at it , she &apos;s in seattle . ok .
but i would leave a child without license control of my tax system .
in some parts of the world , for example in south africa , it &apos;s just hard to have it .
when we saw the effect of the <unk> , andrew , and i decided that we had to grow it , so many people could deliver it out so many people as possible to offer the possible possible education .
what was the special thing about these courses ?
the video will be interrupted by a few minutes and the student will be asked a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of the sciences that have no bad thing about this .
in terms of certain courses , you can wonder what the most <unk> are the most <unk> and how to help students to fix this .
we actually see the beginning of either through a personalized <unk> or through <unk> feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe and what i was my first thought , &quot; it means when i was a kid .
and in our society , of course , of course , it &apos;s mainly about <unk> the reality .
i &apos;ve been here so my doubt about the values of newtonian science , like rationality , it &apos;s expected to be rational in a <unk> .
so you can understand my surprise when i was the new yorker , that alan greenspan , the head of <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> his <unk> mentor .
i think you can do about the fun of what you don &apos;t have and not about the ones that don &apos;t have , and that &apos;s not just <unk> jokes about kenneth <unk> and his <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;ve already got this old times of the <unk> , which i &apos;ll tell you .
he said , i &apos;d have to pay him for him because it can take to the last 18 years to be a really good <unk> .
hm ? yes ? what ? i can &apos;t listen to you . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid , that active somebody doesn &apos;t like us .
and i spent thinking about the delight that you thought about beauty , which you know , the hyde in his book , and he can sometimes have beauty can sometimes be beauty .
george bush : what the defense costs also costs , and what the defense of our freedom costs , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , not an astronomer would be an astronomer on the world -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there are planets outside of our solar system .
many of other ecosystems on earth are actually in danger .
he &apos;s all the time to go wrong with a particle particle , and a stronger effect of that , the world is destroyed .
we need to be able to be the same precaution of the way of the and in the <unk> .
that &apos;s how we don &apos;t want to see .
what can we do about this ?
and now the worst is coming .
we use a lot of money to make sure that we don &apos;t die in a <unk> , but we &apos;re not going to die of nothing . and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get on the wrong foot .
i hope that will be .
that &apos;s very , very important because this is the system that came out on the planet , and it &apos;s now at time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing realization , and we &apos;ve just been aware of it .
and that &apos;s what the system is , a number of <unk> in the southern hemisphere in these circles .
everyone who gets to come up with it &apos;s just to the database that will be used to do anything that &apos;s going on .
we &apos;re about the wave , the technological possibilities .
a earthquake come large amounts of these new microbes that we &apos;ve never saw before .
and the <unk> john <unk> creates a network of <unk> cameras and sensors , which makes our oceans to global , interactive laboratory , the power of the the world -- and the <unk> of the world &apos;s impact .
so i think optimism is going to push the architecture forward .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the <unk> against the . they know , too often , you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know that it is true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
but i &apos;d rather be a little bit of an unknown , and even with mistakes , instead of the same time , so it &apos;s hollowed out by its insignificance .
the risk of food that were still in a very big city .
there are the emotion of the victims .
daniel <unk> builds on a very big ideas . he calls 17 concepts that are basically <unk> -- raw , dared , radically -- and inspiration for every <unk> creative quest .
it also has the lowest <unk> of all the car .
is something that is something like this , or will just give it a few <unk> ?
em : it &apos;s just to just be , if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
and with this capital , and put it <unk> the <unk> on the roof and computing <unk> a <unk> <unk> , which is lower than the electricity electricity .
we &apos;ve almost failed , but we &apos;ve come across this in 2008 .
it &apos;s similar to a jet jet jet .
how to be innovative in the world , a person could be so innovative ?
look at that .
boy , if you eat our livestock and you see a way he eats one of our goats , it &apos;s very nervous . then just go to him .
we were hungry .
our tradition looks like this : in each <unk> , there &apos;s holy fire .
and now we were the support of the world wildlife fund , in the position to build the very small programs to programs with <unk> scale .
it &apos;s also very important -- we invest the money in awareness of aids and hiv .
<unk> -- still a <unk> among many in the world of the <unk> -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful agent .
and we hide this price behind huge .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> are passionately passionate about the <unk> revolution for <unk> food .
<unk> , <unk> , oysters , oysters , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- these were the known species .
this is like a <unk> of protein .
science sees the world through the mind , to be possible , in , , things that can be described and described , but they &apos;re the art of knowledge and insight .
from a couple of cameras , we &apos;ve got a plan for three weeks .
that &apos;s the natural cycle .
that wouldn &apos;t usually do a photographer to do a photograph , is that it &apos;s , but sometimes it has to be the dimensions of these .
here you see , the glacier go back .
this is a couple of cameras .
could india be the origin of , or a global center for innovation , just as it has become a global center for <unk> and <unk> ?
and when we asked people in the <unk> people , they were working on , they were , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be professor , if they weren &apos;t a student .
the best hospitals , in the doctors for treatments for treatments , and at births , <unk> , heart disease , for artificial <unk> , <unk> at 4 a.m.
it works a little like -- this is a recent <unk> <unk> for four in the morning .
i said , i know a bad message when i see a look .
everyone in our society comes into touch with cancer , and if not personal , you know , by a beloved people , a family member , a friend .
in this <unk> , the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we applied tumor fields in the lab in over 20 different cancers , and we see this effect of all of it .
he got the <unk> .
but what we can see is that in a sixth month of the tumor , and it starts <unk> .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new <unk> , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 foot down , and collecting rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe and from their own .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , and soon it looks like this .
somewhere , a bach or a <unk> through this scene .
this is called &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in english , we have <unk> and underwater .
and you have to get down further .
these are the beautiful stairs that we saw on one of the pictures .
and <unk> are 27 percent , 600,000 fewer people get hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they will get the jobs in textiles people who are bringing people from the <unk> and they get them to <unk> and and bring them .
and the countries on the right , you see the <unk> , basically has a <unk> of a country of , say , less than 5,000 dollars , a <unk> of which we say three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india grew up .
buy african products .
but i think there is a much bigger problem with it that this logic is that we should run ipods and not separate bombs -- i mean it would be a great title for thomas <unk> new book .
and then 500 people were to go to and four of them to visit the old institution , and she was to <unk> , and to be about it .
now now , citizens in planning to be , not necessarily about anything about it , because it &apos;s still the dictators that the agenda are control .
<unk> <unk> : does the internet is <unk> worst expectations ?
&quot; how a man . &quot;
and he was hanging out with a younger guys .
because for me , who lived in this time , and in this <unk> , the question was , &quot; do you want to have sex or drugs -- and drugs we didn &apos;t take .
i was like , as a , people .
but indians , and also politicians and <unk> is i &apos;m pretty much about the <unk> who &apos;s our country , concerned , all the talk about india as a new <unk> , even the new superpower .
in other words , let &apos;s tell us all kinds of <unk> stories over countries , regardless of whether they want to have to come to daylight or not .
but there &apos;s a bit of a lot of time in our country , it took this almost half an hour until that a call <unk> .
it can &apos;t understand the dialogues .
and that sometimes have <unk> consequences . ok .
and those of you who have you have the money , you may be surprised to see how many <unk> <unk> on the <unk> are , the <unk> of the <unk> .
i went home and i was doing a little bit of disturbing statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a bath without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this is that expression , comes from a critic , a early critic and this is one passage that i love , and i would like to read them to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would have a a problem , a mother &apos;s a problem : how to get in the world , we get chimpanzees to mate ?
that &apos;s the hardest part , which is not obvious , and so i &apos;ve got it for the end .
ok ? stop . that &apos;s too well .
i don &apos;t know why there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , but no , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i actually suspect that the most likely to know that the most of the reasons we know , why we &apos;re very very quickly , and very quickly .
it looks like this . you should be like this .
bob mckim has a different -- a different version of this exercise in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that with time : you get a lot better , much more creative outcomes , if all of the rules are .
and suddenly , there was a productive conversation about design around design to a <unk> object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll come back to it .
you know , what it feels like , all of these insecurity , as you leave back in the corridor , while the doctors are in one of the <unk> in the <unk> , and you wonder what &apos;s going on .
and so , by all , we all feel that , and we have a good time , because we &apos;re going to agree on the rules and so agreed .
we do everything that leads to success , but then if we &apos;re there , we think we &apos;ve done it , we feel <unk> and stop , to do all that what we did succeed .
i was faster , but as depressed as depressed .
i learned that success is not one-way street .
and the <unk> is just full of hot chicks . &quot;
and i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; hopefully , forever , for always , the last time in public .
he turns out everything all fit together .
and it took a <unk> people of doing it .
and the second thing is that people who experience a real connection .
these are questions .
as you see today , in today modern liberal democracy , the society , the state will not only determine our own selves , but it also requires us to do .
it means that we satisfy our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers that i think about the questions that i wanted to guide them today -- the question : what are the intentions that come to be doing , if you design something ?
so , and then , and my colleague , sebastian <unk> us that there &apos;s better to be better .
and we were successful .
i &apos;ll give you a fall in the fall .
he <unk> them into the right position , she <unk> her nose and beating .
we found the first surprising .
there had to be some kind of <unk> <unk> to create the amount of power and the speed that we observe and the <unk> of the system .
a load load load , and it &apos;s actually a triangular load of a crystal inside .
this is the <unk> -- here &apos;s the heel , and that &apos;s going to make the <unk> and on the load cell .
one very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very <unk> solution .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful , classic <unk> that have been built .
i don &apos;t know any other <unk> , not even <unk> , who just benefit that this is three-dimensional space .
now , you see that -- he just just stand up with me .
the sub , which was out last year , this is this .
<unk> is the understanding of architecture as a <unk> , <unk> , , please apologize the obvious example -- is not the right approach to vote we choose .
basically , new york on the back of the <unk> , the streets of the shells , the <unk> .
in these eight <unk> chambers , small <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which is practical .
so , you walked around the london , and was overwhelmed by this <unk> .
finally , finally created a map of the outbreak .
and that &apos;s happening every week .
i did her <unk> in the top of the temple .
and in this field of the amazon , 72 , in the field .
the other side of the field is in the torah where actually should be osama osama osama osama bin .
that was one of the big <unk> .
that &apos;s the <unk> . let me go and see the hubble <unk> deep field .
but then you go to the jupiter and the is 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
that &apos;s going to be part of the , in which it &apos;s about understanding the beginning of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies .
so the stuff that &apos;s kind of know , dark matter .
and when you saw this image for the first time , you can &apos;t see a lot of it .
this simulation has been trained with 1,000 processors of a month , just to make this visible to the .
with <unk> , we have a resolution that is about this image of the earth , which you can actually recognize the complicated patterns of the earth .
and in the course of course , we &apos;re stressed out .
forty-seven percent .
it &apos;s crazy . that &apos;s what we do is all the time , even in the everyday life .
i got into a vicious vicious cycle , and that led to many pain and problems with the joints , so i couldn &apos;t have any more .
i asked me about that , could be creative , if you look more creative , if you look for the constraints ?
this is not all the time on this morning .
the <unk> is a duty of <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , and there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> monitoring the <unk> .
stalin &apos;s <unk> famine in the 1930s , <unk> million <unk> . in the &apos; 40s they saw the nazis , the <unk> , were burned , raped , raping , ooh , were the women were getting used to the <unk> .
that &apos;s the sorrow . &quot;
and as a <unk> , i was excited about the idea of what we learned in the virtual world of us and about our identity , to make a better life in the real world .
we used to be a new way to be in common alone .
human relationships are <unk> , messy and <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> them .
because in the moment , in the people alone , for a few seconds , they will be <unk> , get it , you &apos;re going to reach into a electronic device .
but we &apos;re in risk , because in truth is the opposite .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t have any <unk> that we predicted the <unk> who were predicted some of our alumni , and quite often -- -- quite often , i felt that she had to make their predictions on a <unk> of a <unk> .
maybe because my father always read us to read .
so i left it in silence -- but it was a long and they had to be a long and they were .
and finally , i thought , i thought , but i &apos;m missing that time , to take a deeper .
although you &apos;re not afraid to have failure , if we gave all the time , and who can be more willing to give people more desires than anything that he can do .
if i should call the name , i never know an answer .
i have enough <unk> ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today , in many clinical trials , many of the future are used to be used for cardiovascular disease .
and just last month it &apos;s been us to show us with this technology to create the building of human <unk> .
we can map them and then and to turn the kidney into all of their <unk> properties , and then we can just take that information and then scan them by print .
i couldn &apos;t go to school at school . i just went dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want to do that . i want to have this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new section is called called <unk> .
and connected to these <unk> , there were examples of the whole world -- from the election to the <unk> wikipedia and everything in between -- the showed that the power of a lot could achieve .
thirdly , <unk> , <unk> environmental issues .
because what you need , that &apos;s the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want cd , i want to music that plays her .
i name my name , joseph and i &apos;m in kenya .
we need to have our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i try to make the infrastructure .
late night , i went home to the batteries and ice .
together : did somebody <unk> ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , the master &apos;s going to give up in moscow , and work on making this .
this can be huge spending , but if the city can win a number of x volunteer for y hours , the <unk> of the <unk> work for the city of the city .
they have <unk> , charts and data .
so that &apos;s then , in the 18 minutes , who were <unk> to speak here , between between two and <unk> people who are going to be in the cities .
and he was in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the building here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are <unk> .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you have to be a political activities .
i couldn &apos;t realize that i would be part of a technological revolution that would be true that dream .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same <unk> of the way i did , helped me to pursue their engaged , <unk> qualifications in law .
and then , it was normally <unk> with a <unk> , but by using a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , he could develop a machine which could actually read the <unk> .
but you know , i find it very lonely to read me from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books on the border , to transport the different eras : the u.k. , usa , usa , and new zealand , all the different <unk> of harry potter potter .
the <unk> . life has been doubled , and it &apos;s growing more than doubled , and it &apos;s increasing steadily for five hours a day .
another one thing . i want to do , and i &apos;m lucky , okay ?
second , the new age of aging is so good news , because when the androids take care of work , we have to do this anymore , and it &apos;s more and more and <unk> .
the societal challenges of that inequality should be considered to be attention .
the economic game may seem surprising , and surprising is , particularly in the short run .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with adaptive technologies , embedded in a slightly more diverse society and supported by an economy that causes inequality .
over the course of years , i started to feel increasingly <unk> with this notion of god .
some of them have <unk> that we can only share a god who divides our pain .
in the second , the line is &quot; wind and waves obey him . &quot;
so who is god , if not the big <unk> or <unk> ?
the loving soul of the universe .
and you &apos;re looking for the god of your inner . by my own <unk> .
one of the first things i started to explore was the story of the <unk> technology . &quot;
we &apos;ve no found out of the <unk> that were older than 40 years , and the median age of tribes are 20 to 30 .
our bodies has used to this new food .
so that sameness of energy and matter , the einstein has shown and also the modern science of the <unk> shows that entropy and information and energy and energy are all together , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to plug your plug in your own plug .
and what i mean is that we &apos;re looking for her a new job .
a great development that started in front of years ago , and continues on and continues . and our choice is to be in the technology that is much more powerful than we ourselves .
and they said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve 30 30 to 40 students , 30 to 40 students .
we did all tear down all down and found beautiful <unk> , <unk> bars , and it &apos;d like that -- while we &apos;ve got somebody , &quot; you know what , it looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited waited , we sat on the table table , and i waited .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> . the only problem , especially for adults who are doing in the <unk> who really knew nothing when they were beginning to have a toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they tell us what we should do .
about 170 tutors , with you , about 170 , and this is wonderful working on it .
and right now -- there &apos;s typically a little chain -- just they saw how children were taught .
there &apos;s also this <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf that you can &apos;t see if you &apos;re in <unk> , but it opens up slowly .
he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s bringing his breakfast .
one email to him , and he will give you any question you can imagine .
i was this girl .
eighty percent of the refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one side that thinks that &apos;s the <unk> of the struggle is , and there &apos;s one side that thinks that peace is the creation of schools and jobs .
she sent her children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s also one , that &apos;s the manual &quot; is &quot; the &quot; did it ?
on the cape cod , there &apos;s <unk> roads , and we all can drive .
that &apos;s my baby . thank you very much .
he basically said , &quot; i designed everything . &quot;
and in a sense , i &apos;ve always felt bad .
so i was in this kind of complications .
i found that cheetos are very good <unk> .
and so , in college , the most difficult , so , is number 10 difficult .
and from all , in a strange <unk> of <unk> that had been excited about a window that was black <unk> , and the white <unk> <unk> was in the sun .
and i was reminded of the great presentation by karen armstrong who really understood it really understood about , but to do with behavior .
the <unk> has seen geographically , the same size , it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s just the same size as the united states , <unk> of an area that &apos;s about the size of the state arizona .
but it &apos;s not just developed countries .
we can &apos;t wait for the <unk> , the australia had to change our political culture .
and this challenge is part of the structure of our entire civilization .
a new appreciation of the <unk> that we have through the presumption of this challenge .
now before i show you a few images to preview , i want to point out on this beautiful detail about <unk> and design .
and that was , in this respect , really is an extraordinary school .
we &apos;ve been discussing tomorrow with keith <unk> , that many scientists are not trying to show something beautiful in their talks , from fear , as dumb <unk> .
here &apos;s examples of that you can already be textiles in 3d printing , which is very interesting .
so that &apos;s what makes us think more about what robots mean to us .
no . so i had to think of a little sharper .
we did the same thing for iraq .
that was a challenge that we had to ask as a physicist .
we can press it up . the forces more , more than they , but they &apos;re weaker .
<unk> 7 : a whole band .
and there are some people in foundations , which is called the <unk> . &quot;
the idea of justice , which gives us the boundaries , and gives us a sense of what &apos;s right in life , what we should do , social justice .
and as this is , he &apos;s a <unk> in the <unk> .
every week would come back in the middle of the time , &quot; god , you &apos;ve answered me again . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , a infection or a surgery .
the muscle were frozen , paralyzed -- <unk> &apos;s what it .
we treat them with <unk> drugs -- <unk> -- the , frankly , in this kind of pain , not very effective .
now , you get this way to make a sense of how much rock we &apos;re talking about .
it &apos;s 1908 . does nothing . so that can i live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see him from the back of the <unk> , and that &apos;s just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called &quot; deep impact , which one -- the one of moving into the nucleus of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts -- astronauts , as i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and we &apos;re that we have a <unk> and vote , and by giving us to change our future .
at that time , i &apos;ve led to <unk> , the only independent , to be exactly the only electronic medium in the country .
and i thought that was going to survive and a great company , if it was only gone , what was really done .
and the end of the meeting says , he &apos;s going to be , it won &apos;t work , you never see your money , but my foundation will put 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said , that -- that &apos;s okay , we make us , her business plan to us with what they actually did .
see , we started to see in our own and <unk> with our work , and they &apos;re walking to russia .
after a while we opened a <unk> .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea of making bonds , bonds on the free press .
and in this way , the funding that we organize the funding , so that there &apos;s no longer , no blind one , the running around .
so , why does this work ? that &apos;s the question .
now , some call this a theory of everything .
and just one example is this : newton finds the law of gravity , which works like one divided by the square of the <unk> between the other <unk> objects .
the more symmetry you have , the more you you think simplicity and elegance .
one thing that he thought was most given us now than being , but at its time , it wasn &apos;t of course .
it doesn &apos;t have the meaning of these fan , that they follow the laws of law , and accidents .
but he read in every free moment , he had the books .
that ambition , he went back to the <unk> .
but when he was just about his signature to put his signature , his hand deaf and rocking on the morning , because he had a thousand hands during a <unk> .
not surprising -- it was only three women under the 16 <unk> in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i i get , the more of the most incredible privilege it was to have an incredible privilege of that aging lions spent so many hours .
and as lincoln was telling the story , all after the war after the war .
i asked my father in tears , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what the reason is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love to the story that allows me to spend a life in back in looking back to the past .
he had the temple <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s the <unk> , this object is the evidence that the jews were in exile after the whole years that they were sitting in babylon of the rivers , and at jerusalem , that these jews go home after the world .
all of these are being respected .
the <unk> cylinder is the <unk> of the great <unk> of babylon , marduk , written .
they all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of living in the living jews of tehran .
some of knowledge more about the living conditions , but they still think they &apos;re a <unk> offenders .
the new <unk> babies cried in the first few hours , but their needs was not worried and eventually learned to try and more and less days , they were <unk> , and start in the air , like all the other .
a study shows that <unk> <unk> cost 10 percent of a <unk> cost , while average cost about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me , because i was living in a a camera , almost all my entire life in front of a camera .
you know , you know , you know , you know , to do a answer .
there were <unk> people -- most of them , and family , and family .
we listened to each individuals .
but of course , he never got . the explanation never happened .
and after many , many , many , many meetings , i was that this man , <unk> <unk> , who really one of my heroes and mentors , it was made to get the boat to get the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in peace and to his possibilities , etc . -- and they made it really .
we connect to <unk> -- i met <unk> <unk> , i said , &quot; at the national 2012 , it &apos;s about truce .
it &apos;s about their <unk> , to get their business .
the biggest brains of the world should be cognitively to be cognitively .
i &apos;m <unk> the peer-reviewed literature , after the origin of the number , but i could never find them .
it &apos;s just a big <unk> .
and amazingly , that fits exactly what our ancestors would have invented a million years ago when they found cooking .
relatively simple ways for the decision-making conversations that i did .
and i think i &apos;m just standing at the beginning .
but once the people fighting the <unk> , the physical rehabilitation was exposed to the rehabilitation .
and after him was a kid , his son , red in the face of effort , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
and i was talking to my bosses in the headquarters and i said to them -- i said , &quot; look , we &apos;re starting a few hours a day , just for some repairs . &quot;
two groups of <unk> started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what is it going ? &quot;
&quot; but yes , we need to increase the production of
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not just in the orthopedic center , but also in the houses of the people .
and you should see me as a <unk> .
and that hospital could have afford to be able to afford .
why ? because the way i had taken , was banned .
but i learned something more than that , which is the leaders -- the the economy of the economy -- incredibly bad decisions that brought our economy in short before the collapse .
because i knew that the state of the african continent was going to be important for my children and their children .
i &apos;m trying to do the experience that i had to do in swarthmore to africa .
it &apos;s all the time ? ok .
we &apos;ve come to a moment from that one great society can rise in a generation .
and you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s a very similar to the yellow ball -- the sun that we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that is something that is something that is going to be a half , not be familiar .
32 pills <unk> <unk> .
i guess it &apos;s a <unk> . &quot;
and those are the messages they convey ?
because , in the bottom , the sponsors , it &apos;s the way , and it &apos;s going to get them on television .
a professional <unk> of <unk> that &apos;s talking to dead , she doesn &apos;t get me ?
what is <unk> ?
we &apos;d like to give suggestions from you to do , like to <unk> , <unk> and community agencies , so they do something .
thank you .
so the whole hospital is often just about a canoe .
there &apos;s something better . &quot;
but so the user can control whether it &apos;s electricity or not , because they can drive the <unk> on the ground , as much as much percent oxygen they give their patient .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and to the best device that we can put in hospitals .
the various species of writing in africa , the first was <unk> , like writing <unk> , which is the <unk> of a secret society in <unk> .
anyway , until 1998 , when a <unk> named john <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in 1800 , who were <unk> in 1,800 centuries of mesopotamia .
almost a fifth of all greenhouse gases from livestock -- it &apos;s more than the traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the animals are producing animals and make animals on the assembly of how tools , it &apos;s not just so good .
<unk> was a in french matter .
a picture of <unk> would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;ll ask you a question .
some of us would argue that maybe not that it would be bad .
about a year ago i asked a question : &quot; why am i , although i know what i know , not vegetarian ? &quot;
it &apos;s got the election .
you can make a picture with an iphone , and all the names , although sometimes it makes mistakes .
it &apos;s got . he &apos;s going to win the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would think that it was interested in interest to figure out more about it , if the stakes are so high , but it &apos;s a very <unk> area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a <unk> or a big artwork .
human nature needs to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s the reason we have a ethical level in which is that they &apos;re intrinsically valuable .
it could be more complex in people , but maybe not .
jh : is it <unk> with these forces ?
and so i knew i &apos;d like to do anything to remote remote .
so there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s the <unk> , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of the liquid .
and so i think that can be <unk> .
this is a great <unk> in the studio .
we take pizza , our first pizza , and <unk> the individual slices , as the messenger sits in the hallway and we <unk> .
i was certainly 20 , before i first went to an art museum .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got a criteria like you want to choose the works .
it &apos;s not photoshopped .
they were interested in creating alternative <unk> , and they needed money , so they decided to make some interesting fundraising projects .
this project called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so we went to the grave , and this was hilarious -- the awareness that we got .
and they describes how the <unk> -- everything she &apos;s like to say is because of the <unk> fruit .
he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of the aboriginal people , and he &apos;s an artist .
it &apos;s combining origami together .
people were <unk> mathematical principles to the underlying the underlying <unk> .
or they &apos;re pushing it on the top , and they can put 50 stars on a flag with 13 .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules to find out of circles , you put them in the dotted lines , the extra rules . that makes the crease pattern .
you can do a lot of things .
but if you want to do it bigger , you could need some origami .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether you go into space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a <unk> in the state of washington with a lot of free time .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about it for hours of about it .
and so i want to talk about it because if we &apos;re not acknowledge it , this is going to be that transformation .
and in a moment i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in in the year in 1973 , just before the women start to <unk> the labor market , and it goes on the next day .
you were instruction from the top .
because i write about all the book , i &apos;ll still be still , and i have not answer that .
and that was very disheartening for them .
since we haven &apos;t processed that information hasn &apos;t really processed and come back to us in form of culture , in that weird and overblown , where you can see that stereotypes are going to change stereotypes .
there &apos;s no man or not a woman who sits in the middle and is the wire to the environmentalists .
and the personal income on a scale that has been held in order to account inflation , in that time , more than almost tripled .
and to listen to me and understand what i say , you &apos;ve already need about 60 bits per second .
and so , in the last book , i was called &quot; good business , &quot; good business , &quot; i interviewed a a bunch of iranian who were very successful and very , very , very ethical , and very ethical , with great social disparities .
now , control is always a safe thing , because you probably feel in your probably , but not a lot of stuff .
&quot; where are you born , grew up to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning to home , and even for hostility , which was from birth to <unk> , and they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond .
more and more people in the future , or the present , the same way in the past .
i went down to the room where i should sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where is you home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but that is the world that we have today . no gap more .
and let me show you why , by applying the <unk> , digital technology .
that &apos;s survival of the children &apos;s survival .
and again , they were better than we said , &quot; her brits and your mortality rate is shocking . &quot;
but if you give people <unk> , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i started working with <unk> , and they grow , and then i worked with <unk> -- mice , which can &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course , i don &apos;t know how old she is .
could you be in the summer as well on the equator .
certainly many advances , many of the lives of life .
this is actually real photography , on the time that shows that the limb is <unk> within a few days .
and here on the right , they see what six months later is , the engineered <unk> .
a <unk> is from two different cell types .
and we put it back into this oven-like device .
more complex organs , and with the most complex solid organs are the high <unk> , with each of <unk> organs like heart , liver and kidneys .
this is still in the <unk> .
we prefer cells that will not reject and not make tumors .
we need only to five seconds .
for every problem there , there was a idea of all the way .
so , i &apos;m actually something in panic , unlike the most of the most of the and sugar and sugar , which i had -- but this is a successful entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to visit a <unk> .
i went from door to door and sells <unk> .
it &apos;s like a recession . so there &apos;s a recession .
and you &apos;d make these chairs .
that &apos;s pointless . &quot; you &apos;ve got to find a way to get money faster .
i sold an enormous amount of <unk> .
they don &apos;t get regular income , but they have the opportunity to find other tasks , and they learn the capacity of the <unk> , and they also learn the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go into a restaurant and bad , they &apos;ll show you how bad <unk> looks like .
this young , <unk> .
the development of the world &apos;s students is to throw all the interest in the board .
the <unk> of <unk> or a <unk> of cultural <unk> deprive most of our students .
the values of the past are <unk> . that &apos;s what makes a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a policy of principles , not the <unk> .
they have a mind . and you have other people .
what we should do is to think about if we think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980s -- what &apos;s here is : they go to the church .
i realize , i don &apos;t really believe that .
and that doesn &apos;t just lead to another result , it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
completely different .
in fact , it &apos;s not a single thing , but it &apos;s clear -- let me finish this -- creative commons offers a simple way to put their content with the freedoms they want to leave you with .
john mccain .
and i wonder how often happens to this .
he told me that he &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , and then said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to be <unk> now . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i &apos;m going to show you through this process and show you what this journey looks like .
and the hospital and general , was happy .
i did it , just to do that we understand .
i &apos;m constantly asking people , &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another way of how microbes , how microbes can spread through the people , architects , the <unk> teams like to do with architects to promote the human interaction or the exchange of ideas in rodents and offices .
imagine a design for a different , which is in account for example , on the airplane or a phone .
and no one knew about it .
my company , <unk> , built a system called <unk> for macintosh .
in the &apos; 92 , his essay was <unk> .
and we did it was a <unk> , and a method that was to do that was , one of these humpback whales <unk> <unk> .
at 78 percent of voices . and to give you a notion of the <unk> victory : the <unk> two in the <unk> , just three percent .
and the last message that i want to share with you is : you can be pretty good online .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a big privilege of it is to stand today before you .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something that we have in gando is <unk> .
just like this .
good morning . magic is a great way to be ahead to be the <unk> advance of what the science will actually be really .
there &apos;s red , and the color black , you &apos;re standing up for the constantly coming from day .
voice : why don &apos;t ? this is a very good piece .
that &apos;s an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , not so a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t lead a country like china , on the ground of a civilization , a system .
and the reason for this , first , the state in china gets a very special -- -- you know , a very special amount of self than the <unk> , the embodiment and the <unk> of the chinese civilization , the <unk> .
he was in <unk> feet long , with beijing and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the <unk> -- the position of <unk> rapidly <unk> -- or the <unk> .
he &apos;s driving on a street on the suburb , and the cars are driving underneath .
red is drums blue by the blue equals green equals orange equals <unk> by ...
and the first song was in english , the second one was in chinese .
she agreed to her .
i made graffiti , i wrote my name everywhere , using the city as canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they all agree that you would have to put her picture on each other .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re a <unk> face -- that &apos;s going to cut a face right ? &quot;
most places that i went , i decided to go to go because i heard about her in the media .
i took more pictures , and we started the project .
are you an ngo ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were taken a woman , &quot; now , i can see god . &quot;
because that &apos;s a big part of it . there are layers behind every photo .
but they basically have lost me a promise .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
and when i think about the domain and what it is , why it &apos;s happening now , i think there are some factors that i want to give you as a <unk> .
they &apos;ve been an augmented trend .
zipcar was zipcar a decade earlier , in 2000 .
it challenges to participate in the city of cities , and cities have been welcomed with participation in the city .
it &apos;s very affordable , and it &apos;s very <unk> .
the last 40 years were extraordinary times .
and miniaturization .
that would be a great <unk> of <unk> .
it is vital that the ted <unk> ideas , ideas about that we think about , and you &apos;re thinking about , and make sure that this is a particularly rational century and <unk> and <unk> .
my remaining family are boring academic , who are engaging with <unk> from <unk> to our <unk> .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he &apos;d be crazy , but something was left .
i was sitting , as you here , in the audience .
this is another picture .
since netra has been my career , i &apos;ve brought it a lot of success .
i started exploring the <unk> <unk> of the human psyche .
this time i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein &apos;s very honored to be here at ted 2006 in 2006 , in the way of being asked to be here in the today &apos;s being very excited .
it &apos;s very dangerous if you would fall fall down .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have trouble . you have the problem , you remember ?
sw : big <unk> .
sw : what about a <unk> ?
my parents found that important for their inner .
if i have a talent , it &apos;s kind of things apart that i &apos;ve got <unk> .
the body has higher density than the water , at least 95 percent of the body comes from itself .
and this is going to get them very far .
and i asked him what that means .
and the point , you can , if you &apos;d like to learn , and they come and they are also take to influence each other .
and she looked up to me and said , &quot; well , well , that &apos;s better .
i think they agree with me that they look very good .
and have done before , in the time , with 50,000 students , so about , a half a dozen schools , my readers , by the way .
we found -- and we were wrong with pretty much things that , and then it then , but we found that the young people loved it .
<unk> <unk> : a little primer in the <unk>
and ultimately the only person who is coming up , a young shepherd , and he goes on fraser and says , &quot; i &apos;ll fight against him . &quot;
there &apos;s the cavalry , men on horses and with <unk> .
goliath is easy prey . he &apos;s got a chance .
so goliath is about the size of the time , and usually there &apos;s an explanation for it if somebody is so far outside the norm .
and i think that there is a very important lesson for us all .
and it turns out that we are covered by a <unk> , and these microbes are actually doing , even well , instead of killing .
they all have the microbes and the ileum in the receiver .
most pills , or the <unk> that you can eat , or two , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands of species .
we need a <unk> for the microbes that in and in humans , so we can understand what they &apos;re doing to our lives .
a lot of people think about the internet is fixated on the internet , but it &apos;s truly global . we &apos;ve got it in many , many languages .
and when you saw him a ridiculous change on the page of me , they probably thought that it was just going to be just in <unk> .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we don &apos;t talk much about truth and fragility .
and we have over 40 <unk> , 40 <unk> .
it &apos;s not perfect rule , but it &apos;s just enough to the beginning .
and i &apos;m like to say that you &apos;re also the only person who knows all the rules of wikipedia , right ...
it seems to me as being as most textbooks that the best textbooks that are being used to teach our children , from being biased .
in the jungles of guatemala , it &apos;s a temple .
a not known american indians in <unk> , in <unk> , it &apos;s a missionary in <unk> , and here &apos;s it .
it &apos;s a lot under their cognitive <unk> .
we found that activity in other <unk> -- in <unk> , which is the <unk> of the treatment and a loss .
i have a friend who &apos;s basically processed on a terrible <unk> .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;re embracing each other , and we think , &quot; and we &apos;re talking about &quot; and we &apos;re talking .
and the tools like that , knife , <unk> , or <unk> that i had put in a towel .
i was looking for a long and wide , but never in my face .
in a few of these , they put together , sort of like sponges to the <unk> .
so dolphins can <unk> and tickle off the distance .
look like they to their partner and the other <unk> of them .
but we were very quickly , because , the <unk> dolphins are not just to depend on a boat on a keyboard .
this is a dolphin called &quot; <unk> , &quot; because she &apos;s about 12 <unk> <unk> .
but while we decode their natural noises , we &apos;re also going to make this back into the system system .
and the word is invented .
there &apos;s yves rossy .
and especially if you &apos;re in the <unk> , you have to make the feeling too .
yr : i just trying to make up the <unk> .
i &apos;ve probably used to use 20 times , in the last 15 years -- never with this kind of wings , but at the beginning .
we don &apos;t say to their employer .
but it was up to <unk> and full of <unk> .
and wondered , the way , how likely to see what they saw , to explain what you saw , to do with the <unk> .
because this event was the scientific revolution since the our knowledge of the physical world , and how we can adapt to adapt our needs to grow , in the way we &apos;re growing .
by the way , why do we don &apos;t do that ?
you &apos;re <unk> , our based on the bible . &quot;
there &apos;s something like a <unk> story .
and only if you &apos;re good , it &apos;s important to you can check it .
you &apos;re not very expensive . they &apos;re pretty abundant .
it &apos;s now using 30,000 30,000 30,000 .
what is minto ?
the new festival challenge the audience to play a vital role in design art .
she had met with others to look at the sultan &apos;s elephant &quot; and it &apos;s done all the time again . &quot;
&quot; no <unk> , that &apos;s good . &quot; first doctor : &quot; is you moan ? &quot;
i thought my career was by .
this is a bear that i sat on the rocks .
this is a piece of ice ice , it &apos;s 12 years old .
i &apos;m going to show you about today , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but this image here is me more than any other one that i &apos;ve ever done .
people said the same , &quot; we knew they &apos;re bad . we knew it . &quot;
and this seal took the penguin on his head and she shook him and forth .
she swam away , and he &apos;s got a penguin .
she tried to do my camera , which is the dream of a photographer .
paul <unk> : stories from a <unk> <unk>
open your eyes now .
did you have a ring ?
you &apos;re going to focus on this task .
joe , we &apos;re doing this for a long until it <unk> it up until it .
funny , yeah , we have a little man , a <unk> , all the day there &apos;s a day .
as i said , it &apos;s shaping your reality .
first of all , we were working with ushahidi and to develop ushahidi .
a call in the u.s. , after canada or china costs five <unk> , or <unk> u.s. dollars .
it &apos;s built <unk> , so you can also join a <unk> and also have to the remote places .
and with the time , the buildings became more and greater our technology , so that the mechanical systems were enormous , they need large amounts of energy .
imagine , two americans , travel through italy .
please , you all the who are liberal .
the best definition of &apos; <unk> i know -- it explains so much -- comes by <unk> <unk> .
he makes us very , very old <unk> .
but look at the other three lines of the other lines .
are not that just the foundation of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ?
it went upward and keep on .
and they say , &quot; hold &quot; hold of my body . &quot;
and we have the signs of <unk> on the right , <unk> , the liberal god -- and both work together .
and so the answer , i think that passionate commitment to the truth , and try to turn them into a better future for us .
but if you react , a lot of other people in the environment that may be innocent , but they might be hurt -- the military wouldn &apos;t like to talk about <unk> .
we &apos;re looking at something else , &quot; and realized it doesn &apos;t seem to realize that the situations actually were very comparable .
is somebody one commandment , how often , if you think of how it was being introduced , how often the police are being in in queensland , in fact ?
there was just a few people who were shot by this shot .
it &apos;s 72 and it looks like this is the kind of the most kind of thing to cope with it .
and if you &apos;re facing them , people will give them , but they shouldn &apos;t cause any <unk> damage . &quot;
we &apos;ve started makers to organize to organize our maker exchange .
<unk> , or <unk> bass , or something like that .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but just ...
but he also moved to the other people who did the same as he did .
that &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and we need to put that in schools , or in the communities , many ways -- the ability to create a <unk> , the world to shape us and form .
there &apos;s glamour of physics .
and in fact , we see these <unk> photos of stars all the time -- it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s not about a way , but you have to think of your world &apos;s mentally .
and so , the <unk> , the <unk> winds , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s always going to be the illusion that if you buy this lamp , you &apos;d be able to get this light , you will be in a world without wires .
the perfect <unk> -- symbolizes through the perfect chain , with the perfect <unk> .
because glamour can be very <unk> and be fine .
but i knew how hard they were working for all week .
i did that many of many strangers .
i heard about women who were separated in their homes , or <unk> in their <unk> , like dead left lots lots lots of lots , with acid burned in their own .
and then i got cancer -- or i found that i had cancer .
my friend did this big bowl , and i asked her , &quot; what is that ? &quot;
it was <unk> friends and a loving sister for me .
because we all are so bad <unk> to do that the inside of our peers , and their secret intentions . &quot;
children need a long time to master the system .
rs : <unk> . -- now , joshua &apos;s going to be get to drink .
rs : should ivan get so trouble ?
and you can see it in the coffee of your friend .
first of all , i &apos;m going to prove to you that it &apos;s a <unk> .
please tell me that they don &apos;t want you to go out , if , let &apos;s say that &apos;s the pentagon that &apos;s why we call it .
but why do you have to feel something at all ?
and it was , you know , it &apos;s a course for <unk> .
and second , it &apos;s possible , or even more <unk> , to slow down ?
they want to go back to a slow rhythm .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland are under the six <unk> nations of the world and work hours to the average americans who would cry .
but the new idea , which is a revolutionary idea of the <unk> , that it &apos;s also as something like &quot; good slow . &quot;
i &apos;m sure , the <unk> of my <unk> , i was <unk> , it was <unk> me because it was so slowly and i was going to be finished quickly .
and so it took us to his first , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build it all on an island ; part of it needs to shore , because we don &apos;t want to shake ourselves from the community . &quot;
i was working on it and i didn &apos;t know it because i felt that people who came from the historical museum already , already with information , already , and if you see a museum with information , you wouldn &apos;t process that anymore .
and when i flew home , the <unk> was planned to .
but you recognize the uniqueness of the environment .
moshe safdie safdie : building
and when christian play a grade -- game for example .
so in jazz , the <unk> is absolutely astonishing .
it &apos;s not about my vision , or something like this .
am i am i exist ? exist ?
they had to come up with a lot of <unk> to come here .
in the summer , india , is extremely hot .
and the adult animal that comes after that , it lives , or two months .
i didn &apos;t know that , but i know it &apos;s hundreds of <unk> .
that made me a little curious . i &apos;m hearing here , because i want to ask you , and here are a lot of people who are -- of course -- people who spent their childhood .
so , next , i was going to be on the phone .
october , november , december . this is not the time of the monsoon monsoon .
okay , they lay her eggs at the time of the <unk> rains , during the <unk> .
it &apos;s just last week , it has <unk> . the <unk> has started and it rains there .
a pretty incredible motivator .
so , it &apos;s an incredible migration of a <unk> <unk> . a pretty incredible journey .
that &apos;s what i did from my life .
and everyone thought , i would be fine . but on the new terrain , i was terrible , and people said , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , what &apos;s happened to <unk> ? &quot;
and in the night of my surgery , i started to and asked them , &quot; how am i going to do this ? &quot;
next -- oh , paying attention . these guys are the community .
so i was pretty successful . and if you &apos;ve done all that , what is it that drives you that , and i &apos;m telling you about the <unk> and other things , but what drives one ?
in my last tedtalk , about seven years ago .
but carl norden really has left the code .
when the norden bombsight is being brought off in an airplane , it &apos;s accompanied by a series of <unk> .
the chemical plant <unk> on over three km .
after the war over , there was a <unk> review -- such as it &apos;s the army , the air force -- and asked the question : how many of the yankees have actually been destroyed ?
i &apos;ve described the opposite of a success story .
a walk in a city or a journey , this diversity of this journey is in the amazing way .
we &apos;re asking questions for the human ancestry .
but what data is based on the statements ?
imagine that , you &apos;d have to be <unk> .
it was a african , which is based on global diversity of the media .
the sahara was much greater than today .
the people who were killing of animals they were in the camps camps went to the north , and after about 40 years ago in the <unk> in the very rare <unk> of the sahara .
the <unk> , <unk> on mars .
we know deep in our hearts that the universe is not moving from mush to complexity .
so there we go .
what you see here , the blue areas are about a thousandth of <unk> than the red areas .
and that keeps over smaller distances as gravity , which explains why you and i are smaller than the stars and planets .
they &apos;re going to be familiar with the double helix with the dna .
let me explain to why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
maybe you ask , &quot; what &apos;s talking about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good when it &apos;s about <unk> .
and then they have to decide how they are investing in 52 choices , and they never heard of a <unk> .
well , at least a wonderful study has predicted it .
but if you get the driver &apos;s license , you &apos;ll peek the box if you don &apos;t want to give you to the organs .
the other group gets two apples , one is taken .
save more tomorrow , it just makes it .
that &apos;s just one example .
it &apos;s a song about one called <unk> , a creature that affects a creature that it &apos;s being interpreted .
hi , who &apos;s because , please ?
thank you .
it has too much influence on the <unk> .
i &apos;m trying to <unk> time .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they do ? they were sending her with her raleigh to separate her human part of her divine part .
do you buy a child ?
elizabeth : <unk> you out ! check out ! check out ! check out !
i went to visit a friend of mine , and he checked me in his <unk> hill in <unk> hill in the north of the moon , a really very rich area in mumbai .
everything is a contradiction .
we lived in less than a dollar a day -- about 15 years .
and you &apos;ve got to use nuts out of the ground to show that forests are worth as a <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t <unk> a person who says it to sleep . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about <unk> .
if on a limited planet , all the &#91; should be sustainable , how can we achieve this ?
coke has to work with pepsi .
this is nine of them .
and at the end , i think , 60 percent of the global production is going to be the table and 25 percent of the <unk> .
that &apos;s not irrelevant .
but they don &apos;t just buy the juice ; they also buy carbon in the trees , to compensate the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that we &apos;re sending the product after europe .
that &apos;s how to cut the communication between brain and spinal cord ; it leads to a complete and sustained paralysis of the <unk> .
after a few years , we &apos;ve managed to develop a electrochemical <unk> that puts the nervous system of a <unk> state .
we &apos;ve been working on , 10 years hard to achieve this goal .
for a few of a few weeks recovery , we put a programmable pump to inject a individual signal directly into the spinal cord .
and i was a kid who &apos;s working-class .
he was talking about the world , as it is &quot; and the world , &quot; how to be . &quot;
and by doing that , these women , these women are a lot of obstacles out of the way .
the white house , and the desk he sits on , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and the woman came up there , the woman who was in there , and we talked about each other , and suddenly she said to me , &quot; would you sing me to me ? &quot;
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> on the voice , because it &apos;s mysterious -- as you can see -- it &apos;s completely spontaneous , and it &apos;s originally .
they didn &apos;t have anything .
so the internet takes <unk> and instructions .
one of the most favorite web websites , the world &apos;s most most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing about what youtube or google could have done .
and today , wikipedia is so versatile that you actually find them on the maps of restaurants in china .
and that &apos;s what wikipedia understood .
this is a blog that &apos;s a blog that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
why ? there &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
the world didn &apos;t finished in the 1990s .
and we see that the impact of the habitat is very strong in some countries , very strong .
all of this costs money .
and it was a lot of being done to students with <unk> or social families to the same opportunity .
how are schools and teachers in the media ?
in the bureaucratic world , teachers will leave the teachers in the classroom and have to have a lot of <unk> .
some people claim that the change the <unk> is similar to a <unk> .
but if you look at the problem of this perspective , you see what &apos;s happening in the last 60 years .
and i walked up with about 15 kilometers to get to the <unk> .
so that was obviously a <unk> device .
we could also do that with phones phones .
so , it &apos;s a business for them .
&quot; the government has to provide economic services . &quot;
it was once , long ago , a long ago when i was 24 years old , i studied at the last st. john , in bangalore at the city of john .
and you can see my map , if i &apos;m put it down .
another , i &apos;m teaching .
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you see that japan is about a time of war , with lower life expectancy .
and they decided to do not only invest in health and education , but also also also also started to grow the economy .
washington , d.c. went out .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the bubble bubble bubble .
are the only wealthy countries that have changed a completely changed global economy and the power power of where they were going to 100 100 until 150 years ago ?
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
but that explains the existence of all the mass .
and so you &apos;re paying attention to the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of a <unk> model of what &apos;s going on the <unk> .
they move from each other because the space is going to be bigger .
by looking at things like clusters -- their <unk> , how many of you have been a function of time -- we can put in experience , which is dark matter and dark energy in competing to form structures .
the big questions in physics .
anchor you asked banjo banjo : <unk> &apos;s bluegrass &apos;s new jersey ?
so recycling and recycling are <unk> here .
marc <unk> : 1.3 million reasons to reinvent the <unk> .
and actually , there was these change in gay men in the united states during the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and also many children .
in uganda , we see that the spread of prevalence .
it &apos;s just close to pretty similar to close .
but openness and linking a prize if we think of disease , that should not be surprising .
coffee is <unk> <unk> .
emily <unk> is a time of the aids in africa , and comes to a startling one surprising : all our knowledge about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i was fascinated because i saw this kind of <unk> italian <unk> .
he was called &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; because it was the front of it , but every time he drove into a tunnel , he built a <unk> <unk> . he was a kind of <unk> .
this is going to make the bumps on the water like a magnet .
and then we ask , why is going to be an artery and why it &apos;s going to be a lot of electricity .
for example , in the <unk> of <unk> in a material .
in <unk> <unk> , my <unk> , we &apos;re working with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
janine benyus : biomimicry in the use
&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and luckily , for happiness .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it &apos;s never going to happen in india because it was now , and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s pray for us . &quot;
this was a <unk> for about 1,000 prisoners in this prison .
second , it &apos;s about the <unk> movement in india .
now let me tell you about a project that we did a few years later , a kind of a new development of captcha .
it &apos;s basically , you start to start with a old book .
the number of pages that are actually used to be so high that the number of the words that we put into a day , very big , very big .
some are more fun .
the time is divided into multiple languages .
and then my favorite <unk> is the question .
there &apos;s a way , two flies to beat a valve .
but what &apos;s even surprising is the translation that we get from the <unk> , even if they &apos;re just beginner &apos;s just a beginner &apos;s just just like the professionals , as the professionals , and that &apos;s very surprising .
because people as you get value , you don &apos;t have to pay money , they don &apos;t pay for money with their time .
the connected side , the company , what it does , what they really can do .
to build part of active part , everything is a normal .
and zipcar provides a very appealing , <unk> service , which is fabulous .
for aristotle , happiness was the highest good , the goal to all the other one .
maybe these people have right . his thought , it &apos;s not good .
ten percent of the time people who thought -- on sex .
i was a violent african , the african terrorists .
now , from the first <unk> , not a terrifying one was a terrifying thing -- so it had no one ever ever reached the absolute majority -- so the election has continued three weeks later .
now here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
so i went to la jolla , and i &apos;ve learned surfing .
people in the 17th century , we didn &apos;t really know so much as we do that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we breathe it from a particular reason and it &apos;s like that .
and so , charles , i &apos;m going to put money to give you a building , and you can meet you there , but you don &apos;t talk about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought that everyone was a little bit of mind that would do this .
just to see what if you put together , you mix the two .
so i have something that &apos;s not personally .
if you want to be rich today , entrepreneur .
you say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it doesn &apos;t go -- it doesn &apos;t go on -- we &apos;re very careful about satellites and it &apos;s not going to go .
biochemist mullis mullis talks about the modern science : the experiment . he shares stories from the 17th century and <unk> the curiosity , inspiring inspiration and care of science in all their forms .
i wanted to represent a kind of a living body , which is this <unk> , inflatable rooms .
&quot; <unk> city &quot; is a convicted of new york and <unk> , &quot; <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that creates from the feeling of the <unk> in an urban environments .
i love to travel , and berlin is one of my <unk> .
and all of time , i &apos;ve seen a single rat in any of these places , until recently , when i was in the city channels .
the first question is , and maybe you write them on , either on a sheet of paper , physically , or a a virtual piece in your head , and , for the audience home , you can see this .
and we &apos;re interrupting , &quot; we are the best <unk> in the world , &quot; because of our british <unk> .
except that -- you &apos;re going to be -- well , in her <unk> , you thought , &quot; hmm , what &apos;s going on during the night ? &quot;
and one of the hardest problems is , if people have a notion of how it works , it &apos;s pretty difficult to change this .
and as an expert of inorganic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues who are different between the organic , the world and the <unk> , <unk> world .
and you can see , he <unk> , <unk> , it grows in a way .
we actually have amazing life forms of life that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself asked a colleague to a fellow who &apos;s thought that life is probably going somewhere in a warm little pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere in the .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally create thousands and thousands of them really , to create in the same size as dna and protein , but it &apos;s not carbon in view .
we want to implant in the environment , and we want to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can create inorganic biology , can make matter , and then it will be <unk> in life .
but there &apos;s a second reason to why i like this <unk> , every single one is .
and they &apos;re very professional female interviewer who sat down for an hour and to ask her to her <unk> questions .
i was sitting on friday on friday on my computer , and i could see the mortality rate of this morning fell by 11 .
as you know , these economists love the money , they want more and more of it .
as you can see , that doesn &apos;t make sense to compute a average of a <unk> that &apos;s not been and this very rapid progress .
but you don &apos;t talk so much .
they were high , or very high , child child , and the families were too big , six to eight .
here &apos;s a couple of people .
whatever is , is worth money .
yeah , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .
and he said , &quot; well , &quot; the <unk> thing in question .
the whole time was a border .
and <unk> , after my opinion , the world will make a difference , not just for a few , but for everyone .
... on the knee , yeah , that would be difficult ...
the <unk> -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to satisfy everybody &apos;s needs , but not everybody &apos;s greed .
and <unk> die .
i went to high school .
and when i was at the council of scientific research research -- 40 laboratories -- when two <unk> were not talking to each other , i built teams .
they &apos;re on this , and now i have apps on the store store .
it &apos;s about perfect to perfect and something old to perfect and something old .
it &apos;s still very hot , but not more <unk> .
because of this reactor is not under a high pressure , and chemically doesn &apos;t be so reactive , meaning the <unk> is not to leave the reactor .
i believe that the reactor that i designed here , which is a cutting-edge power , the great scientific projects that will be on power and i &apos;m ready to do this .
we &apos;re moving to a <unk> , where the experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a manufacturer of the that is the case for the case that it &apos;s going to go in the woods .
and by the end of a long , of course , who he <unk> his son , &quot; well , is , &quot; you know , be <unk> against you .
you don &apos;t usually go to los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk a lot in this city .
and then they will be wrong as false <unk> , by making the properties that they don &apos;t have .
and i was small , i was very introverted and stayed for me alone .
and then it &apos;s just about to start a point and then to make it up to the <unk> .
so i built it from concrete , because it doesn &apos;t matter .
that was this tool .
and for me , that is the most important thing , because i was a child , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
so , 25 days : the <unk> develops <unk> , arms and hands are coming up with 36 days , the primitive spine starts to train these weeks , the <unk> of the the fetus develops the fastest .
the complexity that is in a single system , again beyond any of understanding where any of the math today .
because apparently , there &apos;s this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with these spectra ?
and the day , a colleague of mine , i met a colleague of berkeley , <unk> <unk> , an email with a very interesting range and asked , &quot; can you look at this time ? &quot;
there are two ways -- about <unk> and <unk> stars -- on which matter and chemical elements in the universe made and <unk> .
because can you imagine that all <unk> ?
now , imagine an object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain and we &apos;re just saying , &quot; well , let &apos;s do physics . physics doesn &apos;t work .
and if we see <unk> , and oxygen , then i think , we have the perfect &apos; perfect s
i mean , i just said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you is , you &apos;re universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m very addicted to <unk> , but that &apos;s another talk .
this led to a small collapse -- -- that looked like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is this : not a <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what are you to be vulnerable ? &quot;
i have right , you don &apos;t right . shut up .
we pretend to do what we do , not a impact on other people .
people <unk> their meals , the <unk> <unk> of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , it &apos;s how to make systematic improvements , we think about how to be useful to our <unk> , for our <unk> and self-awareness .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do that we decided to find a new access to health care .
so , steven divides his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this <unk> implant , including these were the only <unk> that were online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have a <unk> , you don &apos;t have data , it &apos;s not going to scientific methods .
that &apos;s the curve about the <unk> .
but my brother didn &apos;t , it was to the end .
if we went from here to the <unk> , we would put on something that &apos;s 300 feet long , 28 miles wide , and it &apos;s two gigatons .
to change the state , you only need two volts of a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do that better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that &apos;s called the <unk> .
they &apos;re the same kind of complex , these are complex complex systems .
and it also has the implications of systemic risk .
so we could put a <unk> bug in each other .
we see the emergence of <unk> and <unk> programs that are trying to understand our networked world from view of the complexity from view of the complexity .
<unk> have a <unk> capacity with <unk> <unk> -- unless you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had 500 of these oiled surgery .
without human <unk> .
so we were up on our <unk> .
and this is not even something that &apos;s invented the data .
and my brain starts to think very quickly that this is a <unk> representation of the world &apos;s representation in the world .
because that question is how our external can predict our external predictions , but the truth is , that i can predict 10 percent of the person &apos;s tedtalk , if i &apos;m going to predict all the external world .
and that &apos;s made of two scientific <unk> and injustice .
we &apos;re going to make people if you open up your <unk> , a positive email from the <unk> or to write someone in their social .
it &apos;s hard to say -- a <unk> , you understand -- my father was the <unk> man in the world .
and so i moved . i went to mit .
they said , make it stop .
they take a giant disk out of cardboard .
he was the first digital media in tokyo .
do you hear that ? how cows ? this is in the morning four in logan .
so there are all these things , but most of love i love to experience the world .
and i decided that with passion .
their culture is not in schools . and i want to see the kind of potential to see how we can overcome this problem .
and that &apos;s why you don &apos;t want to go to schools because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools to do .
and over little moments in my life .
or mothers , who raised boys ?
we need to change attitudes to boys in elementary school .
and you have the impression that you think that would be fine .
let &apos;s see where this is going to be a very quickly .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that , &quot; why &quot; <unk> evidence can give us about the fundamental principles of nature .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to try and i &apos;m just excited about whether it works .
and that was really a important lesson for me , that you can &apos;t really affect any object .

he addiction for forgiveness , and he claimed that he wants to improve the life of his child child child child child .
this <unk> seemed to be pretty happy , and it had no deaths to <unk> , even though dozens of <unk> in liberia .
and how are we responsible for this ?
it &apos;s an alarming -- -- -- that the media &apos;s such a bad job is that a small group of activists in the position , more from that kind of information that &apos;s going to publish the rest of the <unk> .
j yeah . this was the cover cover in the guardian , and it was in all around the world around the world in all countries around the kenya in the <unk> and south african press .

because all these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable , and they &apos;re <unk> -- <unk> for our generation and for the generations of generations .
and immediately , a voice called &quot; whoa ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people come to me , men and women .
hard !
it &apos;s not a need to offset a lack of <unk> .
we are all different from different perspectives .
i was in the way as beijing was to play the olympics .

think about it .
and i was scared .
about three years ago , i read an article in the new york times .

and she started to tell me about it , and all the parents are going to recognize the <unk> .
i have a <unk> history .
our lives is governed by data , and the presentation of this data is to create fantastic interfaces for us to create fantastic interfaces .
i also threw a look at the different <unk> of <unk> , because you can select what you want to highlight out of data .
it &apos;s a <unk> man who sits in the box and controls that <unk> .
a <unk> of about 11 sheep per hour , which is a <unk> of 68 cents .
and in the reason , you can put on the left on the left , and on the right side , you see the <unk> as he was interpreted from 16 people who had no idea what they do .
<unk> bell : daisy , daisy patent -- aaron <unk> : and we took all these individual pieces and put them into another mechanical request in the request .
but we knew that we were all the right person to put us and to make it out of us and we could build something .
and that &apos;s all the <unk> that people who submitted to the project .
thank you .
so i did just jump from pictures , cut , and put them in <unk> .
and a <unk> consequence of that is that you &apos;re always seeing one of his image , and that leads to a very free structure .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to the news , like the earthquake in haiti 2010 .
and then i went 50 miles , then 60 miles .
it &apos;s like the different layers of which we are made , and what we present to the world as our identity .
another is a <unk> in a public library in san jose .
so every building has its own personality .
it &apos;s probably easier to be a better than ever before , to make a good amount of living .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly <unk> .
it &apos;s just too strange .
you know , in the middle ages , in the u.k. , if you met someone who was very poor , called the &quot; <unk> , &quot; literally , someone who was happiness , the fate , not <unk> , was a <unk> .
and that will he do in the youngest court with angels and <unk> , and the sky is going to open .
and i told you the plot of just <unk> .
what i think i really talked about is success and failure .

it &apos;s the only <unk> that interest me .
that &apos;s already today .
the <unk> can be a smartphone , or it could be a particularly <unk> <unk> , how many of these things are special <unk> , because they &apos;re not so good integrated .
many of you have the phillips direct life .
this is a important part of our life . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . let &apos;s now go from sleep to the disease .
so we can change medicine in the <unk> , in all ages , from <unk> or <unk> children to the elderly ; the <unk> arena is changing ; the entire spectrum of disease -- i hope you have a feeling of that -- around the globe .
so , i hope you &apos;ve convinced you -- the implications of the <unk> are enormous and the effects of disease , as well , in all these different diseases and more .
how do we create stable societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a particular called alvin , and he says maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and it &apos;s destroying the whole system .
and so , there &apos;s no <unk> test .
and it &apos;s a great thing .
steam steam faster .
maybe you might ask , how to do this <unk> .
we think of our one cookbook is the only cookbook in the <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robots , and a lecture is always a lecture about surgery .
and surgeons were more skilled people as doctors .
but ultimately , it &apos;s like it .
they had to give their intuitive movement with the instruments .
i &apos;ve been told you about the big , complicated robot .
and as you see , how it comes out to do something useful , that &apos;s not going to stay so <unk> .
and we don &apos;t have to cut on that <unk> .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was my fault .
we didn &apos;t just shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic cost , but also that openness is that openness to <unk> <unk> and make unexpected discoveries .
the film we &apos;ll see is they made for the <unk> in new york .
i &apos;m not an exception .
it continued . they always tried to do things better .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house . &quot;
i think in my family , we had very lucky , because we &apos;ve learned from design .
twilight , very good !
ed : and then <unk> row is a historical <unk> , and there in the <unk> history of the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> in the beginning , where the message has stood in .
see you see this chair ? the orange one ? this is the <unk> <unk> .
because it &apos;s part of where we want to be .
it was <unk> of outrage , they were full of speculation . they were <unk> . no solid information .
one of them is familiar : the population population , the population population , has been from two to almost seven billion people in the last 50 years .
brent <unk> : nice here .
you see the lines check when the population population is happening .
now , before i talk about the cost , i have to make very clear that that it &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that &apos;s that that
this is what liberation actually looks .
but just recently , we &apos;ve been able to make , much technical progress , now the quantum locking and quantum locking .
first , a few strands of magnetic field inside , but the superconductor may not like it , if you move to the movement of energy , and the <unk> <unk> .
this round magnet can also expand to form any of the <unk> edges .
and it was inspired by this quote from douglas adams . the situation is from &quot; hitchhiking , &quot; hitchhiking .
because they &apos;re not going to explain how to do it , you want to do it yourself , and you don &apos;t want to have a <unk> .
but although they were not convinced they said , &quot; okay , we call it back . &quot;
<unk> : yeah , i have .
so some will say , &quot; what will happen if moore &apos;s law on its borders ? &quot;
today , they can buy half a billion , and they &apos;re even better , because they &apos;re faster .
but where are we going to get the software ?
larry page has a passionate speech on our <unk> , in which he was to do for the great challenges of mankind .
they wanted to catch the fish .
it may sound insignificant , but it &apos;s incredibly scary to hear the many rumors of that one more <unk> , greater than the last one , to get the last 13 , or maybe tonight or maybe ...
so the tsunami can be seen as a sort of a <unk> moment , a moment where the blogosphere was to grow up .
probably , it &apos;s probably about three to five percent of the number of jellybeans in the jar , and it would be better than the estimate of 90 to 95 percent of them .
somebody links to one , so , which is another , so , etc . , etc .
he gets his <unk> , and i spend a <unk> <unk> on a lot of doing with a lot of mit , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; that &apos;s all i want to do . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you about 30 seconds of film about the thing without the skin .

these over a wire , and they &apos;re our eyes and hands for the work on the sea floor .
so there &apos;s a barcode on this product that &apos;s what the product is what the product is .
but i &apos;d like to share with you some of my favorite discoveries of the census .
we don &apos;t know why they do that there , we just don &apos;t know .
this is a brand-new article based on a brand-new article that will be <unk> in the journal .
but that &apos;s not all of all .
as an architect , i &apos;ve got this kind of confront .
mitchell <unk> : don &apos;t make a house , grow it !
i find that very interesting and very <unk> , because what you &apos;ve heard in the last few days , the meaning of it , to go into different directions : directions that are specific and unique to the problems .
now , we all think that , that is obviously a large of romantic , many of us , that he wrote some wonderful <unk> , and the most famous essay is a called &quot; a defense of poetry . &quot;
i &apos;ll read it to you .
and at a particular time of his life , they look at on rocks .
but let me show you the latest robotics .
if you used to , before the digital radio , the <unk> <unk> and &quot; <unk> &quot; on the <unk> , that was this noise .
the idea of the <unk> is that we have two source of information to get the implications of the .
that means that i have to make predictions about the future .
now , there &apos;s a very clear example of where a one of me feel <unk> , when he was produced by another person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules to the other person .
if these dots were on a <unk> , they wouldn &apos;t have any idea what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain a lot of the data that can explain to the data -- people actually planning their movements very precisely to minimize the negative consequences of the noise .
this is from the <unk> of marine ocean .
mars has the largest <unk> of the solar system , the <unk> .
that &apos;s my <unk> . it was just a few weeks ago .
the oldest stone on earth is only 3.6 billion .

and there was a guy who sold these guns for legos because lego -- the <unk> -- no , they don &apos;t stand on guns .
and then there are some examples of gnarly stuff are real sculpture .
i have to tell you , for me , that night , i have changed everything .
perhaps most important , the influence on other companies is enormous .
in fact , politics is being <unk> .
in brazil , there are <unk> <unk> , whereas the u.s. only 700 , and <unk> two in california -- and within three years , the percentage of <unk> at <unk> from four percent of <unk> on 85 percent .
that &apos;s not <unk> . biofuels are a really big thing .
scientists , explain -- and these are just estimates -- that we have to halve the throughput of greenhouse gases , and that quickly as fast as possible .
i can &apos;t wait to what we &apos;re tedsters against the crisis .
there are fewer people who are available to be , and then you get this one thing that curve is the curve , and you get this classic classic <unk> curve .
b is on the edge of the network .
and this is happening on every orders of every orders .
the red dots will be the <unk> , and the yellow dots are friends are friends of people with flu .
would you get rid of the immunity ?

although it seems to be a totally chaotic place , if you see it from top , it apparently it apparently a whole web of <unk> and channels that connect every single house .
in this tradition , the future of the world are all their possessions , they will get their new husband .
what a place like the <unk> david &apos;s particularly remarkable , is this kind of <unk> , where people have a foundation that they can do .
we can just ask , &quot; how are the <unk> of the <unk> ? &quot; and experience it immediately -- or what we want to ask .
it replaces the workers of technology .
you can see a couple of the symbols of a symbols of what is the right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older .
or even , if we &apos;re going to be older , our cars , so we can go to people .
they have gone in a moment .
it was increasingly obvious that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists behind the curtain will help me to bring the outcome on the screen .
one of the journalist asked , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the <unk> are <unk> , just like jewish bandage .
i think there &apos;s a couple of reasons , but here &apos;s a few of reasons , but here just just a few of us on the time we &apos;re going to focus on .
he was dressed by the flames , he dressed , he was like a <unk> light , a little bit of a <unk> .
let me go from door to door at the international community , and see if somebody <unk> or forces for these are forces .
but for sergio , it was too late for sergio .
he saw her .
<unk> power : a complicated
this is the jobs and possibilities all the <unk> .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about free from food , because it was actually this year , last year and 2008 , and 2008 , <unk> enough food for every $ <unk> calories .
and i &apos;m going to do in those stores , if you &apos;re there , or out in the fields , to see what they can get , and i find out they can &apos;t get food .
we see changes in participation in the schools of girls .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of getting into subsidies and other things , invest in a school service .
thank you .
we could do that same thing to cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go to a <unk> .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a <unk> device , not because it shows me how many 15-hour <unk> i <unk> every day , but because it &apos;s 24 hours , what i do .
it &apos;s never been shown .
the tar sands of these magnets is so big that we can see a neutron with this technology .
you have to shrink the tumor .
if the magnet is big enough , and their resolution is up enough , you can actually see all the proteins in the body and begin to understand the individual system .
most of us are comforting , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute about the <unk> of a <unk> people .
if i think this -- -- for example , i &apos;ll run a few seconds , they &apos;d be uncomfortable ; longer than a few minutes , and they would leave the hall in multitudes .
they all recognized . and that &apos;s the tune that is the tune to hear the most common in the world .
and i stood there with two very good friends , richard <unk> and kevin <unk> .
while we cross miles and miles from <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , who could be <unk> .
so as i &apos;m standing here and i &apos;m talking to you today , i &apos;ve walked over the <unk> of about five years .
just ten miles before the coast of the coast , and in 17,500 feet .
the ocean expresses climate and weather , they think that temperature stable and form the chemistry of the world .
<unk> are easy ...
that &apos;s the result that if you don &apos;t know that the borders of what we can take the oceans .
in the last three years , the u.s. is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we need to have a <unk> new technologies to explore the ocean .
a lot of my early career , i wanted to figure out how the wings of the insects are able to generate enough force to keep themselves in the air .
let &apos;s see this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful image of the visual <unk> of a mouse from the lab from jeff <unk> . you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they <unk> a <unk> to <unk> any behavior , another one has another <unk> and pattern and you can think that this is in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a <unk> and <unk> computer model of the human brain .
he &apos;s home and drinking tea .
if you look at the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;re making it out of a little bits of it . <unk> processors , like in a computer .
how many of the tree tree have a tree , there are you up ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , every single one in its own processor , and watch what happens .
<unk> <unk> says that the secrets of the brain can be solved the brain , mental illness , memory , perceptions , perceptions , you &apos;re about neurons and electrical signals , and he &apos;s <unk> with a supercomputer that the brain with <unk> synapses .
it would be two or three thousand bombs .
the air force started building smaller models , and it started .
that &apos;s what nasa did to get a <unk> <unk> flying to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about <unk> behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write . because there &apos;s so much of resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people to ask this question , you usually think that it has to do something with the culture .
the countries on the right , those who are very giving , a slightly different form .
i &apos;ll give you another example of this .
but it back to it , it &apos;s more complex .
a online <unk> for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is , that &apos;s what we don &apos;t know so well well .
in fact , in medical , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
infra-red -- can you use to protect the eyes just with low energy .
and your intensity can become very rapidly and it can be turned off very quickly .
they &apos;re critical .
but the way .
cars have <unk> and <unk> and can communicate with each other and and can communicate with the <unk> lights with the cars and so on .
dna is that what &apos;s mean is that all life is being mean .
it &apos;s actually not so many data .
you can be the <unk> genome , and that makes a customized medicine that is better than today -- it has no side effects .
it &apos;s really easy -- it &apos;s only genes -- but we could it it <unk> it .
we &apos;re not running as small organisms in the world , but they &apos;re part of a great array .
the implications can be bad -- if we poison or the earth -- but that &apos;s just a result of a mistake of us .
now , i &apos;m mainly here because it &apos;s a way that you have a <unk> ticket in the time that we have to have a little bit of people who think that you &apos;re a dog , first , the first , of the , of the , of the rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like , &quot; <unk> , &quot; it &apos;s just <unk> . and so they &apos;re being beaten .
no , we do &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; -- ha , he can try it to six to 10 to 10 .
they &apos;re like the golden <unk> .
and i would say , if it doesn &apos;t need it , then it shouldn &apos;t be it .
not just with the pups , but also with the rest of the family .
these are so simple .
their children are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- it &apos;s going to work ?
wk : yeah . i still think about it , to work with energy .
because although i used scientific terms in songs , it sometimes sometimes very hard to make them sound .
and rarer when it &apos;s accompanied by <unk> and <unk> , like in my case .
one is a white light of light .
64 thousand copies .
so let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert shuttle <unk> a mile or two a year .
the homo erectus posed the same tool for 30,000 30,000 generations .
you can teach you in the lab to practice a little bit of <unk> , and there &apos;s actually a <unk> of <unk> in other animals , but the exchange of an object that never happened to another .
it is wealth ; that &apos;s the pleasure of your needs to save time .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for this .
and as people started with objects like this as a widespread , , this is a clue that there was an exchange between groups groups .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but that &apos;s also because of the connections that are going to people , and that &apos;s never been there to make the ideas of the ideas to meet and mate , i &apos;m sure that the technology is going to continue to improve and so the <unk> will continue to improve .
this is the same as a <unk> building , and i &apos;ve got the statue of liberty as compared .
but we don &apos;t think we &apos;re not taking it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , those feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the <unk> <unk> <unk> , is usually the rapid development problem , as we can discover things that change all the time ?
i &apos;ve talked about -- you know , you know , if they were not diagnosed with pathology in the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we &apos;re a part of their viruses ; it &apos;s new , so we &apos;ve got rhinoviruses .
after 10 times a lot of days , they came back -- still a lot of a <unk> -- she has <unk> -- little oxygen in their lungs .
it was not a very often sequence .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody ever saw it before .
a tremendous battery could have this .
let &apos;s invent something that fits the <unk> of the <unk> .
i put a <unk> <unk> with low dense , a <unk> with high dense , and molten salt between .
but david is young and clever , and he wants to create a <unk> , and he &apos;s building -- he &apos;s building the very very very very clear battery using these chemical composition .
so what did we learn from all of this ?
this video was taken in the polar section , 6 miles before the coast of <unk> <unk> , about 20 meters beneath the sea .
so , quickly , we realized our big garage was not enough enough to this growing project for this growing project .
i started to do for mary <unk> and her methods and how they did this <unk> and how important they found that children discover things , and they &apos;re not taught to be a open .
evolution is often often seen this one way that we &apos;ve chosen , but it &apos;s actually a huge number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this up until stage in space .
our cities are at risk , there are many of them on shore .
there are also stars and whatnot .
so , if we think about <unk> behavior or language language , as it &apos;s the language , what it &apos;s called the social scientists , it &apos;s about language . we think about communication .
that term also as proud of , , by jessica , by jessica , she showed that the <unk> people and from birth to blind people , who do that if you win a <unk> .
so i thought about it . you know , you know , and you can get involved in this , and you could get them to try to pretend it and would you engage more ?
what happens to a <unk> , what happens when you take on the <unk> stage , like the same little manipulation of <unk> ?
this is happening in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes , and where can you really apply this ? that &apos;s important to us .
these things . people are kind of the true me . they &apos;re showing themselves .
she was completely depressed , and said this , &quot; i &apos;ve &apos;t have anything to go .
they need your body , privacy and two minutes , and it can impact the other way of the great life .
<unk> swimming to get to their <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , an ant crawling in the brain and drive it up the grass as a jeep .
and you have to have a kind of <unk> , you have to have an answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and i think , what that ideas are not being abused .
and of course they &apos;re basically extinct in the essence .
but amongst all these ideas that are you to inevitably spread the world in the world , are many toxic ideas .
and as in viruses , we should not try to inhibit them .
and in my game , you know , you &apos;re <unk> .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went international on tour .
i know , you &apos;ll say , &quot; t are not in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody &apos;s hearing one . nobody &apos;s familiar with the other .
you &apos;re going to see the orchestra in a kind of <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to realize that that &apos;s not going to happen , but we have to be better , if it &apos;s about to answer the questions that you have to consider to consider , you have to consider the implications and responses to think .
they &apos;re working in <unk> . they &apos;re the rider .
five dollars can save a life .
she earns up two dollars a day , just a <unk> <unk> and told me that she &apos;s neither married married to children before these things are done .
finally , in despair , they went and <unk> a wise old woman .
it &apos;s not again .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;ll be the best talk you ever ever regret .
okay , the great majority of us .
and his message was basically , the council of everything and the unit of everything , and its fundamental value was respect , was a kindness toward strangers .
who &apos;s fighting , while he goes ?
they have to go to go to israel and palestine , in ankara , in turkey , in syria .
and so , more and more <unk> , and so recently , they now have a income to support their family .
just go to someone with a different culture , from another country , with another <unk> , which is somehow different and and get it into a conversation ; listen to him .
i start to start where the story started in 1985 in <unk> .
this morning , before you get <unk> , who had the opportunity to take a shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of those are <unk> houses in which 50,000 indigenous lives , 35 percent of the houses had a functioning shower .
so , 21 percent of what we repair , are follow by <unk> , things that have been built wrong with .
we did that . he got <unk> .
we found out later that in this region , the leading cause of disease and death .
one thing is in context with everything we did , the middle of the <unk> said nelson mandela didn &apos;t have to be a far from slavery , &quot; like slavery , and apartheid is not <unk> . she &apos;s the work of people .
i don &apos;t really bother if they call me a <unk> .
it sounds really <unk> , which is to say , but if you try to use this , it &apos;s so powerful .
and that statement , i &apos;m going to take them in the belief that children shouldn &apos;t leave their community to live in a better .
this is the youngest <unk> workforce in america with our <unk> &apos;s folly .
this is a picture of the bronx mayor who who children in his house , not in prison , so they felt <unk> .
we gave something back .
if you &apos;re big kids with small <unk> , they &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle , which is cool , and they create the responsibility under <unk> , which is incredible .
now , you might wonder about these children .
hold kids from that stores .
stephen ritz : a teacher who the south bronx <unk>
second , i bet you &apos;re looking at this as a <unk> of the difference in the <unk> , right after that sharp line .
in order to 10 , <unk> , the pig suffered a heart attack .
people with migraine , who has an aura , a band with <unk> neurons -- in red -- that &apos;s three to five millimeters per minute to the <unk> .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine migraine headaches , and we need a <unk> . i think we &apos;ve now now .
my first wish is that the <unk> <unk> for epilepsy , the <unk> , for <unk> <unk> -- an acronym acronym -- for the treatment of the other <unk> .
lawyers on <unk> cases on <unk> in the <unk> shares <unk> in the <unk> that the <unk> the poor patients full of pity .
and a half ago , four of five of five who were five of the <unk> in ushahidi , which was called &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot;
how do you know what &apos;s important about it ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i first <unk> it to bring it here .
these people underneath the barrier , because they &apos;re actually going to be out of the process , you know , to share their knowledge with the world .
they have to use connexions and use a platform to develop their <unk> and <unk> that are about <unk> around the world teaching teaching teaching the teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching
yes , books , maybe maybe 100 or 1,000 spending a year .
it &apos;s not surprising to everybody like , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of <unk> are over if people say , &quot; well we &apos;d like to have three or <unk> of them in our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> .
you can use a couple thousand children with two <unk> .
so it &apos;s something like an electronic book .
everybody says , this is a $ 100 laptop , which can &apos;t do it .
and that &apos;s the <unk> .
you click on things and stare at the store . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better opportunity . &quot;
we all play , &quot; i love &quot; i love &quot; on a big line , which is information , and we can &apos;t keep up with it .
thank you .
i think most people think that one mother , and they &apos;re always going to <unk> their child .
that &apos;s not possible . that &apos;s not possible .
it &apos;s going fine . they &apos;re going to live .
first , the <unk> <unk> .
two years ago , one of the mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better healthcare system ?
the <unk> is how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of the gray substance in the age of four to 22 years , she takes to look at what this graph shows . it &apos;s <unk> in the early ages .
the idea that her father is singing in the public , and then she was <unk> .
that &apos;s the <unk> that we built together .
after the first year , it was invited from the <unk> <unk> museum in austria to put it in in his lobby , and i &apos;m happy to say that there was a day , 24 hours on day for almost nine years .
but in the night , while we were , i asked the <unk> , like the <unk> decided that they would kiss sam <unk> .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family has been working on the <unk> for four generations .
honestly , i have no idea what it has <unk> , but they &apos;re immensely <unk> .
the first thing you &apos;re seeing is the terrible force of the <unk> force .
he just wrap it around my leg , picks me up , it brings me up to a vehicle and can bring me to a doctor .
it was a groove in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about you . &quot;
we &apos;ve calculated that 200 years of the end of our direct <unk> with the world .
it &apos;s so easy to see technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect <unk> as technology .
she &apos;s the <unk> of my <unk> .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can tell you , corn is in all kinds of these .
you should know that in every community that is already increasing the number of food crops .
i &apos;ve moved three <unk> in antarctica .
but i tell me where they are , and what country they belong . &quot;
we also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important <unk> for birds , one of the most important in the pacific ocean .
and we as the rest of the world , we &apos;re faced with a problem .
he coined the term &quot; reverse <unk> . &quot;
and of course , the <unk> and the open lake <unk> , but the <unk> , which everyone would like to look at in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific pacific , with huge <unk> and huge <unk> .
now , there &apos;s <unk> , an automatic <unk> , free , automated <unk> , and even on the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate and there &apos;s no conclusions , but if you &apos;re a forever like me , you say , &quot; well , what are we say ? &quot;
and instead , it very carefully documented , which is going on , when technology is to the environment , the first time in a community .
so there &apos;s , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a <unk> <unk> painting .
i mean , that was at least , as it was me happy .
well , there was a question that i was , of course , a while i was in my head , you know , i can do more of the things that i like to do in design , and less of which i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here &apos;s it from the front .
they &apos;re faced with a terrible situation without the direction .
they &apos;re going to <unk> hospitals .
as a <unk> , for example , i was looking at the <unk> of <unk> , because i knew the <unk> , and i know how i have to use <unk> , and i can work with the <unk> .
i saw this value of older people in so many of my friends who were in their &apos; 60s , &apos; 70s and 90s still are active than <unk> , farmers , lawyers and doctors and doctors .
as christian <unk> changed and made of <unk> <unk> , was designed young young jewish men in the u.s. and canada and superman , who was also back to the bible .
the case of <unk> , the last muslim europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe .
the biggest bad guys , <unk> , don &apos;t want these rocks to <unk> , so he tries to prevent them in the <unk> .
and one of my favorites is <unk> from yemen .
&quot; and , when does the article out ? &quot;
<unk> : it has to be something that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous if a group of themselves as a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : islam <unk> superheroes .
let &apos;s see it .
let me highlight it for you .
let me show you this here .
and when i started designing , i was something curious about myself .
so you have the eye and then the concepts come to .
but of course , china has a tremendous population .
but what that is is that this kind of visualization of information is a form of the <unk> .
it &apos;s even a pleasure of pleasure to deal with them , because they &apos;re visual .
the <unk> is named after the eden project in the u.k.
why doesn &apos;t smell like potato or <unk> ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows a little bit .
now after a few months of scanning scanning , i discovered that there is a kind of molecule called <unk> , and that &apos;s exactly the same vibration .
that &apos;s the basis for the device that these two people have built from ford .
they made it made -- and it smells like a like a coumarin .
that was a good thing .
at the time , a series of things are on , where i want to pay attention to it .
and she didn &apos;t have a idea of the context of the context that she landed in .
norman !
i said nobody to go , neither my mother , nor my mother , my my brother , my aunties , my cousins , my cousins , my cousins , not none of us .
i &apos;m reports from that . i just reports to say that i had two things , when i left the children who i wanted to do , and that was a , to find my family and others to write poems .
and this is how we &apos;re looking for you .
and then you hope that one of us in the air and and a little bits .
he had a <unk> , and it has to be a <unk> , and a half of the other family members of <unk> were being <unk> to achieve his age of 12 years .
is that a very good evolutionary adaptation , or will it lead that we will be the of the signs that exists on the shortest edge of earth ?
but will we do that , or will we get to nature ?
and one day , a few weeks or maybe a year , i was with my <unk> in a shop for <unk> , and i wanted to buy <unk> -- we had a <unk> plan .
that meant a fundamental change for me .
my tip : about 70 layers of this , <unk> <unk> .
do you know how i &apos;m really obsessed with ? this project is just for me , and yet i &apos;ve been so far to buy a <unk> newspaper from a <unk> newspaper in a <unk> of the bird to so ...
when we were the way to the the <unk> blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect <unk> : sunshine , the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you ever go back , then just with a <unk> . &quot;
i remember my father and i went out in a wheelchair and i felt from the top to the bottom and i felt the sun on my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;re going to lay you to you , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was enough to me , and i called the school , and i called <unk> and i said that i &apos;d like to call a <unk> book .
and i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and mama and dad ? were never up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i &apos;m looking at it .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> of that through a richard serra .
how to hell , i do a phone in three weeks when i &apos;ve developed these things that evolved over millions of years ?
each of those elements , you could put on the wall as a kind of <unk> .
in his days , he was the highest taxpayer in british .
i &apos;m looking at a single <unk> of <unk> and how they go and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture , but that &apos;s not the <unk> . it &apos;s actually made of aluminum , as opposed to aluminum , and it &apos;s grown .
that &apos;s the car of the future . it &apos;s a <unk> .
if you put it up to contemporary architecture , of course , it feels absolutely of course .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made out of kevlar .
and the same after i did my ph.d. made , i was lucky to be a <unk> of a <unk> who used to explore the ocean .
there was one of those <unk> .
and he uses a <unk> <unk> , like a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> that can blind to the red light , and can you see it without being seen .
so they use it to find food and partners .
i challenge you to give you another science , which is used to have a hundred years old technology .
that &apos;s a magical place .
so i made myself to rediscover the value of the discovery of the .
and on june 5th , i heard a loud bang on the wheel that changed my life and the duck .
and here &apos;s the duck again .
after the price of life changed .
another example of the effects effects of <unk> on life of birds .
so , if i like this -- this is the sound for purple .
the after the way i can do it , i can listen to the eating music and composing .
one of them is &quot; i have a <unk> &quot; by martin luther king , and the others is from hitler .
and now , you can see a more common , that the former <unk> are now the <unk> .
you don &apos;t want to say anything <unk> , which could be used by a . &quot;
absolutely key .
and what happens when teachers want to make all right ?
and why don &apos;t you ? they don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t you dare to the law ?
it &apos;s so that freedom is a <unk> structure .
because life is complex . and here is the hardest and the biggest change : we need to have the authority to interpret and applying the law to judge and officials . officials .
a free society needs red and green lights , and it &apos;s a very complete of a lifetime .
the boundaries for the interest to compute the <unk> , and for the fees they can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard round to cross columns with a ruler .
he had a very bad job job .
he had just a <unk> <unk> .
but the problem , to leave on rules and incentives is that they &apos;re working in the activity , and they &apos;re doing the professional activity in two ways .
so smart <unk> are better than anything , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that any intelligent <unk> can get this for for the <unk> time .
why did this spread this idea ?
people want to be <unk> .
it was a remarkable time . i &apos;m going to sort of a little bit deeper , which we -- america and the rest of the world -- then .
this was <unk> , the <unk> .
we &apos;ve got to do it with a complete <unk> .
what i want to show you is , what it was required to transport the way to transport the <unk> of <unk> .
what would have been if they had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and bring the trucks that you saw somewhere in the <unk> .
part of the problem is that the <unk> itself is overwhelmed by the thought of a nuclear disaster .
it was sent me from someone who &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> , is that it &apos;s hard to be hard .
there are many black sheep out there who did the wrong things that have gotten the wrong things .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them ?
it &apos;s <unk> , a dangerous work .
suppose we could , because if we could do it , we could get more .
the governments that are most progress , the governments , the ways that have found shared value in business business than the government to see the the actor to see the the actor .
maybe i can cut to a way to look at the brain , and i can change my <unk> .
i want to take a kind of kind of .
come back to me a moment with me , just june june , june .
we certainly could be all so productive , if facebook or twitter wouldn &apos;t us much at that time .
they did <unk> the british government to get money for babbage &apos;s machines because they believed that this machines would have tremendous practical of practical effects .
these benefits not only because they did not only for the <unk> of the research , but they also also <unk> to look about the <unk> , instead of answering the <unk> questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you how to learn something about life .
and once you look at the very little stuff -- this person has written a whole article , and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all the ones that are not enough enough , they have no idea how this infection happened -- which is by these floppy floppy .
there are about 10,000 programs .
this would be the frequency of the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> in one of the <unk> of the words of text text .
everywhere , all of life is , you &apos;re just that distribution , unlike the distribution .
too hot , too hot .
the officer says , &quot; are you sure ? hey , you &apos;re sure you lost that here ? &quot;
that &apos;s the data from one survey in a single in zambia , from a few years ago where i was <unk> .
as you see , bruce willis in the time had a lot more hair .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i could get the time or it fit in my plan , and i &apos;m not just on vacation .
instead of how to put the paper paper on the cell phones , we should develop software that enables you to do with without practice without practice without any of the <unk> .
that &apos;s less than i was doing it , if i went to two weeks as a police .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , or in the balloon , we need to change the height .
that can be on spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need to do .
i promised me that i would take this next time to take the world , not to take a fuel , regardless of the fossil <unk> to be safe to be being trouble by being being trouble by being being trouble by being being trouble by being being trouble by being being trouble by being being trouble by being being trouble by being being trouble by being being trouble
i think you need a pilot in the plane who can talk to the universities who can talk to students during the flight flight , and can really be able to make it a human adventure .
and what is the goal ?
that &apos;s why all people who believe in these mindset , welcome to this mindset , to be part of this team .
now you need a laptop .
anyway , for us , we had a magical place .
the next thing i want to do clarity is what this problem is , and what it &apos;s not .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop for a second with the nonsense .
the fact is that we can see the first generation and that extreme poverty can see , you see on the ocean , they say it , and they don &apos;t have to stand .
it &apos;s on the nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for the leaders of the <unk> states who are established and the history of the world .
people find that slowly .
and with this one campaign , which is a <unk> , and i was , and the organization , data , and other groups of the energy and the enthusiasm from the from the <unk> to the south of america .
and step , step , step forward , a nurse , a teacher , a <unk> , a <unk> , and life will be saved .
the idea that the internet which all changed their lives , a country can change a country -- and a continent that &apos;s just as to analog , let me bring it down to the head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes are volcanoes .
now , your job is to see what this shapes kiki is and which is kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not <unk> , then that sentence , literally , false .
if we &apos;re going to solve a problem or something new , we &apos;re going to see what we know about what &apos;s not known to us .
nadia <unk> : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t fit to all these kinds of reference .
pm : i don &apos;t think that .
how are you about that , you personally , but also with their <unk> ?
some of my reporters were arrested .
and that &apos;s clearly a different picture of yemen .
my heart was a half times .
this is a list of the side effects : if you eat too much salt like a <unk> and <unk> sandwich , you probably end up in intensive care .
but soon , i was going to <unk> symptoms , and i had to to <unk> myself , knowing that i probably never would never see my home .
and i sat there and talked about it , with the <unk> of body and asked him what if i had a transplant , i could do it for me .
i was on a dozen machines that thought of life .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these coalmines also has been also in the united states to 200 percent .
and also , interesting is that the same thing that is the same business that causes us to atrazine , the <unk> , &quot; the &quot; -- today the drug is sold -- a and the same company .
we also started a <unk> .
what would our kids say to us , if she had to say , i had a little bit of <unk> , some artificial <unk> , and a little bit of a bit of a. a.
the problem is that you &apos;re in my village , oakland , in most of our villages of our villages .
here &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> next to the airport los angeles .
i offered five cents for every <unk> .
the <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s become global .
you see , in red , the spread of the <unk> .
they &apos;re like a mouse that looks like a mouse that looks at the foot of an elephant , and the most part of you will leave behind them .
they look like their <unk> and <unk> comes from all the directions around us .
redwoods have a tremendous surface that expands in the sky , because they tend to something called <unk> -- repetition .
<unk> are giving up a canopy stability , just like a cathedral , and help the tree , longer .
it &apos;s absolutely <unk> to see that .
but recently , all the doors to open up and the walls break out .
this was 25 years ago .
so let &apos;s take a look at the <unk> of the <unk> .
how do these people do that , then they get money with these infected computers ?
and you can afford to see how we work -- how <unk> work -- and try to find a way to find a way that we &apos;re meeting .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see a <unk> at the bottom , <unk> / <unk> and if you open this image file on your computer , and then print this program , and <unk> .
and if you look at the pictures of the scene , you can see that the marker of the mercedes <unk> .
we need to find any way to make sure that all the computers is going to be .
but i &apos;ve got nothing to do .
this person surrounds with consultants .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
what does your future look like ?
those forces disappearing , no one is 2011 .
it would be good if people were <unk> , and this kind of calculation would take seriously and participate , because this would change things , but it would change things in two types of ways .
that means that we can tell a copy of ourselves , and if you &apos;re using a part of the <unk> , that in slow out , and <unk> and <unk> .
and the happy number , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from her <unk> , and saw her video was a sudden , like a <unk> .
thank you .
you will go to the distance .
that &apos;s what it was taught to do , then he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i &apos;d like to mentor , who taught me how to browse .
what is it drives you in life today ? not about 10 years ago .
what are you doing with what you &apos;re going to do , and it &apos;s going to happen ?
didn &apos;t that -- time . didn &apos;t know -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t have ...
in that moment , or <unk> , or <unk> , where you &apos;re going to <unk> you to something that you can do meaning , and whatever it means , it makes emotion .
have you ever done , and you &apos;re going to go , &quot; that was me ! &quot;
to death , so , in his infinite wisdom , gave us another human need : the uncertainty of us .
but that is true : we need it . we can do it by intimacy , by friendship , by prayers , by <unk> in nature .
and there &apos;s seven different points . i can &apos;t go through it , because i &apos;m through , the last element is .
jewish man with family in occupied , someone in new york , if he had been working on the work , and that man who wanted to be a terrorist , and it was very clear .
instead , i &apos;m going to be interested in the tools that a large number of people can tell their stories everywhere in the world .
the color of the particles corresponds to the kind of feeling -- happy , positive sentiments , bright colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the whole day in the computer . &quot;
and if i go over here , the list starts to walk , and there are thousands of feelings that were collected .
ten subjects , the <unk> of the and circle the time capsule .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click on this and see this iconic iconic image of betty , how she sanghamitra the <unk> of her husband &apos;s race .
you can also look at quotes , if you like to read a quote to the climate change .
so people feel clouds than something that is in the way .
in the , it has tens of thousands of members in nearly 100 countries around the planet .
they just need to step out to go out and to notice that so commonplace , so commonplace is that all the other is missing .
so look up , you really admire the <unk> beauty , and you always think of the head in the clouds .
they &apos;d put 25,000 recordings together that would have this this way , &quot; <unk> , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the <unk> to buy my first <unk> , and it was a huge machine .
this is taken from a virtual autopsy .
and here you can see how the knife is to the heart .
it &apos;s a little , mechanical pen that in its interior , very fast <unk> into it .
now this is a really interesting project now .
so he does .
so , very skilled people .
i went to the children as much as possible to the to the academic stuff in the real world .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly <unk> of all , which we know about the foundations of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details , why we think the universe , but it &apos;s coming from the mathematics and tries to explain the physics that we know .
and over the course of my career , i always <unk> something in me .
year 2001 , i went to a <unk> .
we got a lot of <unk> .
this is what it &apos;s the first four-year in 2004 .
he &apos;s a short four-year time ago , and recently , recently , which you all know .
each is a <unk> <unk> , but in a different scientific discipline of disciplines .
i &apos;ve got my first computer as a teenager , and it was a really wonderful device .
he explores the brain using mri and he claimed that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned .
so , in the next few slides , i &apos;ll give you this story about this .
transistors are getting smaller to enable this , and that &apos;s what our technology is much better .
our <unk> is behind this lens .
i had such a gut gut feeling that we do it wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so , we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
i like to call them the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , because they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
we can see more and more detail in our galaxy than somewhere else .
and that &apos;s what a factor of 20 .
so there was a bunch of alternative to the notion that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put lots of stuff in there .
it pulls a lot more than than the other and the cloud will break apart apart .
and i hope that i &apos;ve convinced you that we have to really have a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
and one day , i went to the streets of new york , and i saw some children between stairs and <unk> and playing playing baseball .
so for instance , the people like the <unk> of the 11th , the <unk> , the this thing .
in the first eight centuries in the first eight centuries of this tradition , the big one was the great thing in which , to praise god and prices .
through new and <unk> instruments , the age of <unk> .
but a question is , what happens when the music stops ?
michael <unk> thomas : music and feelings in the time
so we &apos;re starting to be a new <unk> .
and then 1945 , it took it to 100,000 a year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , although i don &apos;t know where i should start .
wow , a volunteers , great !
but recently , my interest was been interested in a new view of a new view of the time where there can be where this really cool can do .
well , i think this is the most powerful development of a problem that we call &quot; crowd-accelerated innovation . &quot;
but the element of the desire is really the most important .
we get a great talk of them back .
so let me introduce me about this slide sam <unk> .
but even if you &apos;re <unk> the screen , it &apos;s much more just by just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s going to happen right now .
how <unk> global innovation is investing .
first , i have to do a to be a service to do a service and talk about what i &apos;m going to give him instead of saying what i cannot offer .
and that they were fun to design your <unk> , killer or <unk> .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they keep them alive and give them the sugar , so a kind of <unk> that we call superpower .
this kind of tests do this up , ok ?
somebody asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
and the thought he could reverse the waves . he couldn &apos;t turn the waves .
i think there are three big changes , and in the areas of transparency , choice and <unk> that people have a real power .
how do we do that ?
my <unk> , sharon <unk> , claims to the world of more pictures of her back from any other .
11 from 14 countries .
and second , they would take the <unk> teachers and take surveys , and they would like to make a sense of a <unk> , because they &apos;ve made in specific areas where a <unk> sense of making sense of a sense of a sense of a sense of a sense of a sense of a sense of a sense of a sense of a sense of a sense
so i &apos;d like to all the great weekend .
to read dna and write dna is getting simpler and cheaper .
<unk> work alone .
now , you might ask , &quot; what would i do in a <unk> ? &quot;
if you have this <unk> around the world , this can lead to a <unk> , which is going to be biotechnology .
the law allows him to be strangers or <unk> , who represent an economic risk or a <unk> or a risk for health care or the <unk> of the state .
these laws are a smack into the face for science and based on prejudice and ignorance and a opposition of traditions and a opposition to <unk> .
why are you pregnant if you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 <unk> people who inject drugs .
such a social worker who spread condoms to endangered <unk> , not even <unk> by the police , <unk> or <unk> .
here were children born , people who died there .
building for personal work now are now .
they remove the high line , the street , the the river below the street , and you get from one to the other , to cross the <unk> .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny homes . &quot;
and jobs should be shared .
your liver makes <unk> oil .
and they kill the 12,000 sharks at the time , by a <unk> from the <unk> <unk> bay <unk> <unk> .
we know very little about them .
so this tags is that the place of a shark , depending on the time and the sunset , the water and depth .
let &apos;s see the <unk> of what to do with the genes that are passed by the parents , then we see that basking basking sharks , compared to the first study , one of the factor of 10 , less than others .
so , refined this research and found that the size is to 9,000 .
and what was fine . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build on it . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark , before we take a sample , we can &apos;t tell if it was from a male or female .
so i decided to give the <unk> myself .
your body will be cut up by <unk> , and they &apos;re being used for any <unk> to make money -- people tell a lot of those stories .
not business with anybody .
my journalism may not fit in other continents or other countries , in part of africa , it works . it &apos;s about corruption , ask the people immediately , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in downtown the 1980s , two blocks from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t be as a <unk> <unk> .
and had these people ever met to met a victim of their predecessor ?
today , in 29 states , you can be more than half of the country , because of its sexuality are going to be fired .
and finally , i realized my mission &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a million of different <unk> of being gay .
at least , i hope that it will harder to be more difficult , their rights .
first , the world is , and it &apos;s always going to be good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the <unk> .
and thirdly , i had access to all 1,000 pictures who made the soldiers .

that &apos;s me . i &apos;m .
what we have is is exactly the same thing , the same thing , but in one of them feel great , and in the others , with just a small change in the posture , feel awful .
but i think it &apos;s a different argument that has to take place to control that level of control , which is we have about our taxpayer .
for <unk> percent of that money you could have put <unk> into your trains , which not have been reduced the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the utility have been improved .

we removed the whole <unk> , and the <unk> paint which this just <unk> <unk> .
many of these ideas fins in the produced trailer of airstream .
if you think about it , your kids to tinkering tinkering school , they will come back with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
but let them play with their own conditions , and you can trust them , you &apos;ll learn things that can &apos;t learn from the <unk> of the <unk> .
if you want to throw it out a device , you don &apos;t do it .

in this mode , he tries to keep his position .
i thought i &apos;m a little bit of how nature creates materials .
let &apos;s think about the future technology , we start beginning the world .

so , when you ask people , where do you go to , if you have something important to do ?
i &apos;ve been on my desk , i used my expensive computers .
and what happens -- sometimes you have this room for eight o &apos;clock in morning , or or seven or when they get up , and you say , man , i didn &apos;t get a lot of sleep .
in the office , most of <unk> , and distractions that people actually attracted from work work .
we all know that that &apos;s true . you would never have a <unk> meeting that &apos;s being <unk> .
meetings and managers are the two major problems in companies , especially in offices today .
maybe every two weeks , or every week , once , once , a week , <unk> , who nobody can talk about .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m doing this for seven years , and i have no idea how the future will look like .

it challenges the norm .
and he kind of have a tribute to <unk> values .
at the same , the spread of these mobile devices , we &apos;re going to see an expectation of availability .
our current reality is less interesting than the story we will tell about about .
what we talked about ?
dean ornish shares a new research that show how the <unk> <unk> can impact a difference in the genetic level , and he says that if we live healthier , exercise , exercise and more love , our brain cells actually productively productively reproduce .
until i tell you who said , who said it .
within that context , we can seem feel regret about many different things .
when i went home to my tattoo , after i get my tattoo , i stayed up all night .
but i want to suggest that there is another fifth .
i mean , even the stupid &quot; answer to all the &quot; <unk> can make us back for days for days .
and as i used to say i &apos;m a <unk> .
i thought i would try to try to try to do my ted wish , and how to do this is what they &apos;re trying to do .
none of india . now , there are at least a million active active .
and i thought that was that somebody in all of the ngo &apos;s the organization of the world &apos;s organization must be thinking .
and so we did that , and that &apos;s what we did .
listen to that , less than four one-tenth one percent of those who were treated , they stopped the drugs or <unk> in their drugs , and in terms of their treatment .
it &apos;s a try to try and i think it &apos;s successful .
the <unk> are not <unk> .

i can &apos;t turn it out because i have a little hurdle in , right ?
if i take a magic train , and then one , it comes a third .
galois has a series of laws that made for these these charts , they &apos;re interacting with .
this is a piece of the symmetry called <unk> .
instead of all , i want to call , i want to know how many digits you have that number . ok ?
i need to have your name . symmetrical objects have basically , please spell it for me .

for me , the doctrine of unintended consequences , that &apos;s what &apos;s happening is that chaos , we &apos;re going to do this best .
it works with every computer and browser , negative , minus , minus and the text is getting smaller .
they don &apos;t need to delete extra to delete extra .
and therefore , a kind of information that i &apos;m inspired by , my real desk .
one means that it would be something like a <unk> , so you &apos;re going to get the more traditional desktop , the things are in the grid .
now i get to my music with my hearts and there &apos;s no borders anymore .
but i think that &apos;s the point , it &apos;s metaphor with it , and with such a bite , i want to suggest the role of contemporary math -- not just <unk> , but mathematics in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there are 2,000 physicists now on wall street , and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flying you might have <unk> on amazon .

this is a relative to the <unk> in boston .
and then , the <unk> takes the piece , <unk> it , it &apos;s looking at it under the microscope and then then what the operating room .
so in this sort of pattern , they can create a solution to create a solution with a magnetic compound , with a magnetic , which is stored in the <unk> of one cancer , can &apos;t separate those pieces of those molecules .
with <unk> lymph node as part of our today &apos;s <unk> <unk> , the average surgeon , after the average node , where cancer begins .
if nerves are damage , they can cause , and pain , and pain .
if we put these two samples together ...
we know that this is feasible , and we &apos;re compiling to realize this .
and this cell is one of the a thousand different types of people that we learn .
it will affect the normal circuitry as the ones that they are the ones that they want to fix them .
and one in the summer of 2004 , we tried it and it &apos;s been working in the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that already , a little ant releases of these cells to be able to learn that .
and it goes . now .
i want to end with a story of a story that we think maybe maybe clinical application .
now you can see that the animal actually can actually be the walls and <unk> and the small platform , and you can use your eyes .

in california , they will send it out with a <unk> , &quot; this product contains chemicals that are the state of the state of cancer , and as the cause cancer , <unk> and other <unk> . &quot;
so we might have come to develop a <unk> that requires humility , and for my profession , it &apos;s a fortune to say that words &quot; humility &quot; and &quot; &quot; architect &quot; &quot; &quot; the eternal <unk> &quot; &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was , &quot; stone stone didn &apos;t finished because they were coming out of stones . &quot;

if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you use it .
since we &apos;ve been the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the most common database that we will be put in the public six weeks .
now , we now have a hundred <unk> of heavy <unk> <unk> on the internet .
we started commercial and mixed with the building with the building so that all the people have centers and places where they can stay .
and this is the <unk> <unk> in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s not let anyone tell you that we knew all of all , because we didn &apos;t know it .

all these empty areas , are the areas where the temperature are coming through .
and the creatures of a particular cell , to clear to clear , it &apos;s what the 25,000 genes are switched on and what they switched on .
now , pundits come to play and make basic anatomical <unk> .
we take the clear material and put it on a <unk> .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at all the genomes and they try to find the <unk> that are associated with genes .
whether it depends on the individual genetic background or their experiences , we don &apos;t know .
we know how we could we <unk> poverty , we just have to do more for it ?
so here &apos;s a couple more questions .
how can you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , before it was all right .
and there were a lot of experiments that came to the same result , so that &apos;s why i &apos;m just going to tell you about one .
so what is the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it . and we need to drive the policy .
and maybe we start small , with things , where we &apos;re sure they &apos;re going to work .
poverty is more <unk> than scientific work and a lack of data about the effects of <unk> , the question of <unk> , and yet <unk> esther duflo , they &apos;re possible to find out what <unk> <unk> help and the damage -- with help <unk> studies .
so we start , because africa is , in a certain way , in the sea .

i think it &apos;s right here is the focus .
i asked incredible questions -- &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how will they end ? &quot;

how are we going to be <unk> , which is the responsibility and the causes of a court ?
and you have to be in all the ways including which i &apos;ve never seen before before .
i hope you &apos;ll see it , if i &apos;m these examples , because i &apos;m talking about everything you could spend their time .
now , there &apos;s magazines about water .
people pay the full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they don &apos;t have anything together .
the corners of <unk> , the center , that &apos;s the big market .
these guys are the <unk> <unk> of the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be <unk> -- you don &apos;t have to be completely <unk> .
so what you have to do is to figure out who is interested in .
nine months later , i <unk> messages on tahrir square , and i was a picture that i saw in my <unk> .
thank you .
most of the cultural legacy of us in us to look back and look back and the past .
my first story for national geographic , where i realized that you can bring environmental issues in a documentary about the history of nature , i had devoted to a <unk> .
these are the lions and tigers of the ocean .
and because i &apos;m very obsessed with them -- i &apos;m kind of obsessed with you -- i wanted to do a different , more positive story about the time to talk about the need to use protection for sharks .
after i had <unk> , i found that this habitat is going to be <unk> to create a new <unk> .
they caught in <unk> .
but as the fish came back and back sea urchin mountain and the population , and growing forests , the seaweed in the shallow water .
she &apos;s now in the jungles of <unk> <unk> , and this is <unk> , your second son , the second son of the second , the second , the second of the second , i &apos;d saved , <unk> .
it was a biological desert .
and then you see the returns and start measuring what comes out .
so how do we break this circular loop ?
and you need bacteria to bind the nitrogen and without those microbes will not be any performance .
the moisture is 10 percent higher .
so we can really change the climate .
in <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the law to protect the law .
the <unk> of the <unk> , the one <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;ll show you one .
<unk> <unk> creates <unk> sculpture , beautiful works that move inside the pattern of <unk> or <unk> waves . and he <unk> us with his <unk> art -- at the same time of mathematics and nature .
every city has their own design .
23 years later , you asked us to come and this idea of <unk> .
this is italian portal , the <unk> park , the <unk> park , the japanese plaza , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or anything , but not a case of science .
people always say , consciousness is hard to define
you can &apos;t think about the existence of your consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain and to create awareness , we have to find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly bringing the maira and subjectivity as the things of reality and the properties of entitlement .
you don &apos;t find ?
but i also also meet people who do what they do , and they can &apos;t imagine something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in the u.k.
teen don &apos;t wear a <unk> .
maybe later , not immediately .
no , don &apos;t do it .
i could just not get this thing to work , no matter how often i do , or how much i do .
but we need to change from a industrial model in which morning can flourish every single in a morning .
so erez and i wanted to figure out more about it .
the reason for this is that the historical report is going to be digitized in the <unk> process .
and she went on . she said , &quot; okay , so it &apos;s serious .
she led a group of students in a protest in the streets of <unk> .
i stood up , a tea , sat down , and i &apos;m here , and i &apos;m here -- still almost , but here .
so peace direct <unk> you to the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; by the <unk> to democracy , &quot; with <unk> architecture for resistance .
it &apos;s not such a <unk> thing .
and actually , chris was worried , and said , &quot; look , show you this photo , you &apos;ll think that you &apos;re still one of these crazy modern artists who are not a lot . &quot;
it &apos;s an object for the mind .
and the solution that i &apos;m concerned about is the biggest culprits in this massive <unk> of the earth and the <unk> devastation of the biosphere .
so i asked , &quot; what would be the t of the counters -- what would call him <unk> , where they were actually <unk> the effects in the denominator -- we call it <unk> , bring where they get the implications ? &quot;
and he was a tremendous <unk> of the market that has increased our sales and profit .
we literally won <unk> .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i got an email from glenn thomas , one of my people in the meetings in california .
so , frankly , we have a lot of us that are in the industry , the industry is that the industry will be under technology and possibly <unk> .
and truly , we need to do somebody to communicate for us so that we have a experience with a sane divine ?
the arts , whatever they do , let us take us , and if you &apos;re us to take us to see our own to the and curiosity .
three three sisters , legend <unk> with her passionate playing a new life , at tedwomen , they start with the dancing and <unk> <unk> , and then they play a <unk> , <unk> version of <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the manchester craftsmen is after my neighborhoods .
he &apos;s making a bunch of money through making a special furniture for rich people .
we took taken the curriculum of the american <unk> , which is the harvard of the <unk> , and we <unk> a <unk> for mothers in <unk> in this <unk> center in the middle of the city .
we have noticed that flowers have to give you flowers and and eat sunlight and and and and and and and and and and herbie &apos;s music , you can save the way to heal the way .
these children who are born by the world , the of public schools , and that &apos;s what they can do ; with affection and sunlight and good music and self-esteem .
and it &apos;s got to work all pretty well .
and i will allow you to take the concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music , and you should ever decide to sell you to sell you to sell you to sell you to sell you to sell it to the support of school . &quot;
this is a room for nancy wilson , the the album of our school last christmas .
the brown building is that you &apos;ve been looking at you and i tell you where i did my big mistake .
he came to me , he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he has a group of people .
bill <unk> shares a calm and powerful history of redemption by art , music and unusual alliance .
and the transducer then takes the <unk> to the code of the brain , and the result is a <unk> that produces a normal <unk> .
but there was a <unk> thing , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better answers to make ordinary responses , and that was our contributions .
they cover us with a invisible <unk> , the attacks from the environment that we &apos;re going to be healthy .
but when bacteria grow and and around and all of them are involved in order to make these molecules , then the number of that molecules is proportionate to the <unk> .
now we know that all bacteria can talk to each other .
this is just a photo -- a <unk> of your skin .
bacteria are incredibly <unk> , which is that we kill antibiotics .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and that they can fulfill the tasks that could never be able to do if they were just to act as individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor for me to get to this conference .
or the first one that come into the room .
but , if we think about justice , aristotle says what we need to think is the real character of the <unk> and qualities that are worth that you &apos;re <unk> , <unk> and recognized .
what a reason they would have ?
charlie , what say to warren ?
here &apos;s how he <unk> it .
so aristotle has flutes , <unk> and <unk> marriage marriage marriage marriage marriage is right .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic
many people said , &quot; well , you know , <unk> have not have a rural guys to say what we should start with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future humanity has to make such a decision .
so if that &apos;s what is that is what is that ?
i &apos;ll argue that the speed is going to be good .
i think that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that there are this threshold because we don &apos;t get more aggressively complaining before we reach a <unk> age , and that &apos;s the damage for before our birth .
that means , you have to do your homework to understand if that &apos;s true .
audience : hi . i &apos;ve read that in the last 20 years , that &apos;s been <unk> on the last 20 years , the average life of virtually every years has been expanding .
not one of your media has done it .
we don &apos;t care how we do our bidding .
they went into the center of <unk> and <unk> <unk> on the agenda .
but i can &apos;t have a <unk> account and the <unk> , the <unk> , the case i &apos;ve learned from economists , epidemiologists and <unk> .
the <unk> is something scary , and probably you know it &apos;s a part of the <unk> .
fourteen americans die a day on asthma , the times of the <unk> , and almost everything comes from <unk> .
he had felt sense of humor .
politicians and <unk> have fear to <unk> as a &quot; <unk> . &quot;
second , because we &apos;ve had it eradicated .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s try it . &quot;
there &apos;s some amazing animals .
immediately immediately , the government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;ll go on . &quot; and paid people for it , every <unk> you saw .
he may probably think he had the <unk> baby , so he &apos;s actually need a little help from the outside .
i asked peter , if something changed , and he said , &quot; no &quot;
we want to talk to africa : the next chapter &quot; and this is a healthy , <unk> , beautiful african .
but most importantly , they have to be productive in their lives and a kind of productive environment in our countries that can be done .
we can we connect it all ?
we were on the side of the <unk> .
i had to get between the legs of these legs , with my sister on my my sister to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything .
and often i don &apos;t see african employees among them .
now the question is now , how we can use , from all this good will , that will be us against us ?
you &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
we have <unk> <unk> in nigeria with the <unk> .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective to a <unk> product , i decided that we can study them , so that we can study them , right so , as we can study any other complex neurological neurological process .
the method has been applied since the 90s to study extremely complex .
i want to try to show this for you .
and then i &apos;m in the room room , play in the change .
how do you study a rap scientific ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity in which is in <unk> .
i want to say to compare recognition and statistics , that &apos;s the mathematics of play and <unk> .
it &apos;s very time-consuming , and it &apos;s not pleasant .
but the way it keeps the thought of the eight seconds .
in play and virtual worlds , for example , you can be used to be their facial expressions and intuitively , to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise it &apos;s almost a very fast , and without a stable grid , it &apos;s not possible , so children die .
another statement of esther , that we respond to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s made by the <unk> , and it &apos;s a very interesting thing .
we have every street , every <unk> , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in her <unk> , a very cheap blue laser .
audience : yes !
and interestingly , although we have a time , we &apos;ve never done it , and i still have managed to get the air in the air .
this is the restaurant <unk> house .
and this is actually a <unk> that you see is actually actually buried in a <unk> area which was spun out into the outside .
so , water is a very important thing .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; &quot; are still .
the idea is not perfected .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touches water , you should listen to the air out like it .
and once we sequenced those two genomes , we asked us , if this is the smallest genome to be a <unk> species , it could be a smaller genome of it ?
and more of us , we realized that once that worked , a real chance of that , if we could bring synthetic chromosomes to the bacteria .
so , care about <unk> .
the last thing is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t build myself , that can &apos;t be able to understand . &quot;
but actually , we &apos;re actually , in the northwest , very close to the very far of the koran of paradise , which is <unk> as &quot; gardens , <unk> by <unk> .
but the more one more than you add , the more one is lost .
and that &apos;s never going to 72 in the .
this is a nest &apos;s nest colony and it &apos;s the nest entrance .
that &apos;s a colony which has been established by a queen in the previous summer .
the <unk> -- that &apos;s what you &apos;re like to represent a magnifying illustration , and they &apos;re a very interesting group . it &apos;s going to go early in the morning until the first group of food .
oddly , and interestingly , it looks like , as if it &apos;s just doing anything about half of the colony doesn &apos;t do anything .
the nest maintenance workers take out and they put them to the <unk> edge of the mountain and put it down there .
but the <unk> , but not get from , not get .
and we did experiments that show that the longer one ant is widening it , the more <unk> on their surface , and so that &apos;s the ants in the same way they &apos;re doing different .
they all all the earth except the earth .
here you see that the cost of all of all of all of the world in about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost of three trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s what we do for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
it has nothing to do with it .
i think about where we can use the natural gas .
and as i &apos;m going to put it on the <unk> of gas for the <unk> of gas .
why does that worry ?
it was just 500 million <unk> .
and that &apos;s never been underwater underwater or something .
tbp : i lost 150 million lost , ok ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there was <unk> . and there was <unk> .
<unk> life is an event . they &apos;re announcing it the world .
this is in <unk> manhattan , where you built the first <unk> of the first <unk> .
and that was , in maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to <unk> light socket .
a friend of mine told me this story , who didn &apos;t just come and wait , but then the <unk> , when they were there , the third time , they had to call someone to someone .
and so sometimes i &apos;m going to use a clinical language , and so it may not be so warm to the heart of the other conversations about compassion .
and here is the basic idea that <unk> is to good for people who are going to be <unk> .
basically , if you &apos;re my enemy or my <unk> , if you &apos;re not my friend or my family , i &apos;m much less to use the golden rule on them . okay .
so , the results , the results up on . this is a game game .
so any form of interdependence , <unk> , force one to recognize the humanity of others .
and they &apos;ll explain to you , the other think that america is not respected and they &apos;re even dominate , and they hate america .
most diseases related to poverty , but in the case of cancer , the children would be all of the children who died in cancer , mostly from wealthy families .
a week , a child died , but nothing changed .
because you just don &apos;t really do that kind of energy and time it doesn &apos;t really care .
and so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
now , the dominant <unk> , is that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cell cell cell , and that this makes you to a <unk> cell .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of <unk> material that had the actual extracellular matrix , we put the cells in and lo and behold , within about four days , they were <unk> and on the right , what we &apos;ve made in culture .
and of course , we &apos;re asking now , where we go now ?
and so i want to close with a poem with a poem .
we &apos;ve got a <unk> journalist who was caught in the <unk> , a boy <unk> , whose book has so many <unk> quotes , which is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the new york times .
it sounds a little like a strange book , but it &apos;s actually about new kinds of lying .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about themselves . surprise .
you let &apos;s have four good friends to their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is she bad ?
i can lie to lie early , they were talked about and then they were .
they were telling , how big the chicken was , or said the <unk> , the <unk> are so far from the hotel .
woman : right there . okay , c , take a photo !
and then you want to <unk> your eyes .
but it really really opened my eyes , how often i have , from life , for emails , social networks and so on , although it actually actually really important or <unk> .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of <unk> .
and everyone who got <unk> , i went behind .
well , at least , because if i always do the same , i &apos;m very , very boring . i &apos;m very fast . i &apos;m very quick .
i see myself as -- i don &apos;t know what i see myself .
are you going to be nervous , <unk> ?
im : do you worry ? you look like this .
how do i think it &apos;s good , but just that it doesn &apos;t <unk> , ok ?
if you have the <unk> for a long time , it gets buttermilk .
i call it the era of citizenship -- what people are different different race or <unk> , but but as citizens are all the same same .
in egypt , i was ultimately discovered .
this had been in the middle of the yemen , in yemen and in a plane in amsterdam to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and the symbols that are using the democratic culture of the ground .
but an anecdote , we can show that if you were going to be poverty , well , is the top of the british families , is one of the richest families .
what happened there was a political coalition that &apos;s going to be a political goal , and that was to steal the leaders .
these tools are going to be more interesting if they &apos;re more likely to get more .
he <unk> the boundaries of individuals , and then they <unk> them .
and because of social media , chinese students who studied developing , or companies from the rest of the world in china , there were people all over the world .
and the last half-century , the chinese is through .
we &apos;re always globally in a media media media globally , social , are , and it &apos;s cheap .
but it &apos;s all in the <unk> , i &apos;ll still take a show as a result of what i did .
in my fourth bobbing , a comet , a comet over the mountain .
this is the <unk> <unk> . the first 600 meters of the rise of base base .
and this is in camp camp .
and there were the climbers on this summit summit .
we also got the bad news that beck <unk> , some of the climbers in that storm collapsed and died .
it &apos;s so hard to work up there , sometimes i even put syringes in the clothing .
this climber was <unk> .
and i can only <unk> how he did it .
and so he will turn back back into
these are sherpas , the <unk> of the light .
and the fourth thing that &apos;s really relevant to me , &quot; ideas that we need to share with . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , by entrepreneurial food , entrepreneurs became entrepreneurs to models , and they &apos;re at great levels of society .
it was <unk> people who wanted to do democracy , because they were doing the ideas to get the world , parliament and the world , parliament and the same .
the third thing is back to the cities .
the second is the <unk> that we have entrepreneurs to do so difficult to create standardized , in standardized , 93 percent of indian jobs in the <unk> .
so if you &apos;re a young country , you &apos;ve got the chance to implement a modern <unk> , so that you don &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> when you get older .
you have to have a clear strategy , which is important to india and important to the world .
so the government decides to choose to choose .
although some people on the left didn &apos;t like to hear it , it actually actually the revolution that were the <unk> revolution , which was the government has no idea . &quot;
they don &apos;t fear the mass .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the <unk> and those who represent them .
<unk> .
each of this whale whale whale would have been statistically , two years after the <unk> .
david cameron invested 20 million pounds into a &quot; social <unk> fund , &quot; to support this idea .
<unk> <unk> : investing in the social change
i &apos;m working on . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the <unk> ?
even when i &apos;m there with my friend called jack , i &apos;m like , &quot; i salute you , jack . &quot; <unk> , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t found it , my name is tom thum , and i &apos;m a <unk> . that means that i &apos;ve just heard about , just and just with my voice , just with my voice , just with my voice .
and to the end , with this one , with this one , i can put my sound <unk> , let my sounds .
our people had to try to try to find about 5,000 different pieces of information to find the right thing .
don &apos;t you on those who say that can &apos;t create it . everyone can do that .
on the right side is a <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to give you some examples .
you see the blue <unk> transducer .
his wife said , &quot; the happiest day in their lives . &quot;
many of these patients are pulling the <unk> .
the results are better than the surgical .
he can roll the surgery at any time and stop immediately .
<unk> street , i know .
and that is where you really get a lot of your creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that runs both of the same .
and so they want to go to the next trend and possibly possible .
and their jokes , as the <unk> of a <unk> , work really just within these aesthetics .
you need a lot of lawyers and lots of time in court , and the <unk> decided that it would be much too much .
these are the two flower of them in the logic of the <unk> logic .
and i &apos;d like to thank you to a really thank you that this very <unk> presentation presentation .
and once , a boat was brought me to a remote <unk> , and i realized that the <unk> that i shouldn &apos;t get to meet .
i think this is one of the most <unk> and <unk> things on the planet .
there &apos;s numerous ancient <unk> on the u.k. , and if you &apos;re your hands , you &apos;ll notice that the <unk> <unk> on the churches were .
here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , which is about <unk> years old .
i hope that i find these organisms , i can help , to look at their remarkable disturbing , and my part to protect their <unk> longevity in the near future .
let &apos;s put it on something else .
20 years later , still use mobile phones still , but they also make their own <unk> , like this , which is the <unk> mexico in all 31 states .
what did they do with this ?
what could terrorists do today using the technology now using this technology ?
recently , the fbi has arrested a <unk> in the united states , which these <unk> drones to transportation from <unk> in the united states .
as we see here , we turn ourselves in cyborgs .
now , there &apos;s the mortality of 70 percent , if you get it , but it &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s so many people killed that the single <unk> funeral in the <unk> <unk> of this outside of the <unk> juarez is possible .
but on the other hand , i hear the people as being fear , a certain aversion to risk risk .
and very , in 1999 , when they worked in colombia with the <unk> <unk> , with the goal , to keep her culture and language , with two other colleagues of the farc trafficked and tortured and was killed .
and there &apos;s no group that would be more more than young men in this kind of thing as young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for the people who are simple solutions , light categories , because we don &apos;t think it &apos;s pure instrument .
but the whole community , all the different <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , would be sat down and praying . &quot;
because the <unk> , when they &apos;re full of the juice , you &apos;re beautiful , they feed the world , you &apos;re feeding the world to heaven . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , let &apos;s see these three portraits .
i tried to do a little joy to my wife .
why do i don &apos;t know , a local <unk> , it made ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because a company is going to bind off cotton and it works .
<unk> : i see this thing in my wife , &quot; why do you <unk> a bad rag ? &quot;
now , 110 110 countries to access it . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i was in the last seven years .
and then i did a huge amount of training . i swam in <unk> and i swam .
it actually happened , the cells in my fingers and <unk> and <unk> .
and my good friend david saw how i thought , and he came up to me and said , &quot; lewis , i know you , since you &apos;re 18 years old .
the prospect of that , in 30 , 40 years , could be a very <unk> .
u.k. , america , japan , south africa , the congo .
it &apos;s about 380 billion gallons of oil on earth today , which is still being invested in what .
now , that may be the end of the story -- okay , we &apos;re just replacing it all with conventional , renewables raw raw raw raw raw raw raw raw raw raw raw raw raw materials -- but i think that &apos;s the one of the story .
very special material that the abalone itself is producing millions of abalone , all the time , every year .
and the idea of this was basically , that i &apos;m the paintbrush in the hand of great personalities and i interview .
but i wanted to interviews , who are different .
in fact , my first <unk> was george <unk> , who was 97 , and she was a <unk> of life life -- i think you can define it .
we know the great <unk> , we know the great moments , we know what we don &apos;t want to communicate and the meaning of the thing is to make someone ridiculous .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it wasn &apos;t that <unk> , but it was a <unk> for my conversation .
he said , &quot; but i understand that . i can understand this .
half of the body was banned , the other ones .
this is a <unk> in kathmandu , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to do fine .
there &apos;s a particular type of treatment , it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s not the painting that we had made , but what we actually drew painting .
another example , again , a stupid mother .
thank you .
no , we &apos;re talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss <unk> , on the <unk> of the the the minister of the the the the the the the the high public state of state .
they even <unk> .
most of the big companies are also convinced that they need to be very strict policies against the bribe , etc .
if you want to go into a restaurant , if you look at the menu , then you would expect it to order on the card ?
and that was the first time i thought that the expression actually reflects on her face , which is what it thinks about him .
well , he divides his life .
this 18th century painter had been known for his life , but occasionally , people .
unfortunately , these reformers spends their most of the time with a series of <unk> in the archive , and some of them are beautiful paintings .
the first time i was wearing it at a <unk> meal for a <unk> meal that gave her parents to honor us .
&quot; i congratulate you to your coming wedding , james .
my father lived most of the most of his <unk> in east africa .
i &apos;d like to show you six minutes .
<unk> <unk> : but our films , they are stories with whom can identify our people .
so , to really a young man out there , and it really has to be thinking about certain negative things , and you know , to behave , or some of <unk> behavior .
franco <unk> : so much of the time , so much time .
i think this is really the theme of this event .
franco , you &apos;ve described this as a <unk> film called the world .
it &apos;s basically a cd . it &apos;s a <unk> cd .
now the art critic , oh , this was fantastic .
that was really fantastic .
but games can be very profound , even though they &apos;re completely <unk> .
we &apos;ll show the portal because you &apos;re going to turn on walls to create new spaces .
so time , space , aesthetics , and then , most important , behavior .
on the way , i had to leave a few bridges behind me .
everything is to the <unk> and students who who was the first meeting that you &apos;re denied an <unk> place .
so i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and gnarly things that i normally drew .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss army knife for me to be an area of <unk> .
and one day i had -- oh , the other way .
i have the <unk> and the copper and <unk> , so it &apos;s <unk> .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .
and it reminded me why i was so <unk> in things like my house .
she was never completed .
the dome was a wish of <unk> .
it was an attempt , this little bit of a small piece -- it &apos;s 30 at 76 feet -- it &apos;s 30 at 76 feet -- and that , and they separated these areas and and the dining room in the bookstore , with a big space in it .
they call this &quot; plan &quot; plan . &quot;
here it is .
from the building appears like <unk> iceberg in the mountains .
and our client , not art galleries , so , and when we met our new acousticians , he told us that this was the right shape .
in barcelona , i asked to make a fish , we &apos;re working on this , to get the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
can we make cleaner <unk> <unk> ?
and one of the things that she found was that they didn &apos;t <unk> .
and this is our <unk> briquettes briquettes .
and he has compared the problem of the health effects of wood and charcoal .
it &apos;s a place where for instance , if this was india , in this room just three of us have a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same concepts like in the united states to make the things .
there &apos;s a big difference .
after surgery , it &apos;s a surgery .
now , this is not surprising . but we also asked them to grade their honesty and intelligence , kindness and <unk> .
he married . he had a son named <unk> .
is this business with our fortunes and our employment with this is a <unk> phenomenon ?
i want to tell a little bit of the surgeries that we do , how far we are , and where we want to do .
we can replace the bone structure under the bone structure , but we &apos;re not very far with the <unk> .
my topic is the food in schools , because here &apos;s about social justice .
and the next is <unk> .
people talk about sustainability , but we should find out what it is at all .
you know that all think they &apos;d have to have to have more and more food ?
and then , you know , you know , hey , hey , we can sell the stuff on children .
and this is a typical <unk> .
the things that we might do to do and for so important , we need to teach children in schools in schools .
we need to educate the staff .
that eight billion , the way , the two dollars of the way , and 120 cents -- so much money , the government is ready for a lunch .
and when a little girl sitting sitting in a hot <unk> with me outside the sun .
when i go to a party , and i ask people to ask me , what i do , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; will be <unk> .
i want to know their <unk> , everything about their <unk> creature , <unk> -- that they &apos;re in a professional in their own conscious .
don &apos;t get rid of that , and i &apos;d rather like to be <unk> .
it &apos;s a documentary in <unk> about consciousness .
when i was closer , i expected to see all the details of most people , their clothes and so on .
how do you know that it was what they did ?
see it ? who doesn &apos;t see it ? it &apos;s going to help .
we start <unk> . some examples .
today , this morning has described to his efforts , a good , great theory to bring in neuroscience .
and the <unk> in london said , &quot; what my favorite you to do , &quot; who is in charge of school -- &quot; i mean , no one is in charge . &quot;
well congestion congestion were introduced in stockholm at the third of january , in 2006 , and the first picture ; here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , a typical road on the month january of january .
so , we did this enormous survey with lots of <unk> and trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
and then i went to <unk> for 20 years -- by eastern asia -- by the hills of the caucasus , <unk> <unk> east , north africa , russia .
what do we know about the taliban <unk> who are the doors to the doors to the door to send their daughters to schools like in <unk> ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was tidied up , i had the blue <unk> on the walls .
and there was even two of them .
there was really what .
how amazing is that ?
now , i want to talk about a couple of other patients who are doing all of the things in their power to improve the health care .
and then i realized that the page of google earth reminded me to fly where we can fly to each address .
we are , they are most most vulnerable resource in health care .
<unk> from seawater is a <unk> .
here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take their own environments with any sound waves . i &apos;m talking about the <unk> .
in the united states , the annual cost would cost to estimated 22 billion dollars in the united states , so bats each other is wealth .
why should we deal with aging ?
if you go out right here and look at this beautiful , flying animal , i &apos;d like to see that smile . thank you very much .
europe had to be <unk> into economic development .
the commodity booms , <unk> <unk> <unk> in that , but many countries the bottom billion countries .
so what &apos;s going wrong ? why is it called &quot; <unk> &quot; ? &quot;
and so the countries have the bottom billion a very <unk> policy .
a few economists came up in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try to get a auction ? you &apos;ll reveal the value . &quot;
in that moment , there are a billion people in the world , or <unk> countries , and how can we help them ? the economist paul collier asks a suspicious , compassionate plan to make the gap between the and the gap .
we don &apos;t have a container where they &apos;re produced .
here he is telling a brain surgeons in africa in africa , which is that <unk> , which is required to deliver more intervention .
so we did this : imagine , imagine , imagine , a lecture and could tell people in their native language .
&quot; foundations of surgery surgery .
i was a first time ago , i first came across this regular material , <unk> , which was used for centuries in the same .
he &apos;s asking me if i could build this as a <unk> piece of the city .
so we were experimenting with little <unk> <unk> to generate a dry fog , and then it turns out that it can be shaped by people who can interact with it , and they can move through it without being <unk> .
they were in their <unk> in their <unk> , watching the <unk> patterns of the <unk> , to the people who didn &apos;t know , and shared the <unk> of the miracle .
and so , it became the attention that this is an enormous risk of our society .
if peter moves his arm , is that yellow blob you see the right place to the activity that the activity in <unk> mind .
if you do this , what will you want to control ?
and to say that these changes changes that can be beyond the death of a single fact , which is of course , true or wrong .
now let me make me clear what i don &apos;t say , i &apos;m not saying that science can guarantee that space , or we will have scientific answers to every <unk> moral question .
now , why would this an objective morality not <unk> morality ?
how is the probability that this is a very the top of human development ?
on the left , you see edward <unk> .
we &apos;re living in a world of technologies and these technologies can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s always easier to break as they &apos;re together .
but then we have to talk to the more of well-being in a major context .
and what is the natural enemy , what the means of the good beetle &apos;s the good beetle ?
it &apos;s a parasite , not a <unk> wasp , two inches long , slim , slim , a fast and <unk> <unk> .
and if we plot this good <unk> to a <unk> plot , you go to the flowers .
in israel , for example , where we &apos;re on about 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s equivalent 10,000 of israeli <unk> -- biological <unk> in <unk> , 75 percent of the pesticides care costs .
thirdly , to increase the awareness of the farmers to increase this <unk> .
<unk> is one of my favorite .
it &apos;s still fun about the <unk> of making fun , and i do that often .
<unk> <unk> -- that &apos;s what the new yorkers needs .
her <unk> name was <unk> <unk> , and so that was -- i wasn &apos;t <unk> enough to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or the soviet union is just a few decades , maybe within a decade , after time , after the soviet union was most most most powerful .
because there are 80 percent there , the really food is the food out there .
they are at the beginning of <unk> .
why do we actually do that all the soup , but it &apos;s already meat in there ?
it &apos;s 25 lbs per person , a year .
we &apos;re now going to decide to do that , or to five kilograms of output .
we can increase it a little at a cost of rainforests , but it will be a very soon to give a limitation .
and you might think , well , you &apos;re not available .
my three minutes didn &apos;t have , right ?
he then said , &quot; ah , we have to put it on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if canadians have the system , they do it in a way that &apos;s a good benefit of .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the great idea .
this is a <unk> . and on the back , some other gadgets , <unk> , and scales , to make some computations . okay ?
right . so , this is what &apos;s used the device .
there &apos;s a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is amazing and remarkable .
so , the first robots that i want to talk about is , &quot; is strider .
it &apos;s just used to show that if you have cameras or other sensors because it &apos;s up , it &apos;s a foot , you &apos;re up , it &apos;s 100 feet of <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
for example , in this case , although the left left and the right wheel and connected to a single axis , and so fast fast .
welcome to <unk> , the robot mechanics lab from <unk> tech . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the <unk> .
let &apos;s see it . this was all the first time , and ... <unk> !
but what is the secret of our success ?
but just from a radio of the imagination is not enough .
in this kind of education is very important .
<unk> , the <unk> .
there &apos;s certainly no pool of good <unk> teachers , and only eight percent of the county have a <unk> or a higher degree .
there &apos;s a total empty of the creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have to have to have your <unk> to the wheels , then has won the team .
over the last few decades decades , but a lot of money that was destined for shop , it was entirely away .
and after outside , and the neighbor of what to do , what they eat and where and why , why is a homework assignment .
in this is literally impossible , to create large ice .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of the <unk> and to explore .
after four months old , it comes out and now it comes to <unk> months before .
here &apos;s a couple of results .
now , this global action is leading to climate change , how to treat fossil fuels , maybe even more than that .
when i learned about these two things , <unk> me , both of personal reasons , and for scientific reasons .
it has a very well <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is partly of the thomas &apos;s the state mcdonald &apos;s foundation .
after treatment , we &apos;re going to make a a series of simple <unk> to see how his vision works .
the answer is in motion . that &apos;s what i want to show you the next video .
i &apos;ve had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re tracking these <unk> , and hopefully hopefully more results to report .
and then , i &apos;ve got from these <unk> to a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , and i thought , oh , i know , i don &apos;t know , but before i choose to , i look at how this is like this .
but this was in the fall of 95 and then when the winter of <unk> , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , then , it &apos;s been watching , to the <unk> &apos; <unk> in 1996 , and she &apos;s very excited . your family travels -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried to anyone who i could , <unk> against who who are against the moon , so against who am i going to do here ?
i always had all won , and now i thought , what ?
you can be <unk> . take it off . &quot;
moderator : aimee and the designers will be two and we &apos;ll talk about design , and we &apos;ll talk about design .
she &apos;s got someone who came up and the shoes of <unk> .
it &apos;s almost impossible to explain the real losses of the economy , it &apos;s because we use math math .
or about the 75,000 jobs .
and even more about the mathematics : mathematics looks like a lot of like math -- like this -- and sometimes you don &apos;t do it -- like &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in education , we &apos;re using about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to step back three of hand .
so if people ask me , is that ?
but automation allowed to separate these things , so that &apos;s what the driving is something else as building a car and learning about his <unk> .
wrong with it .
but i think we can do both the same same time .
and one of the reasons why that is so important -- so it &apos;s very important , computers in the exams .
it was in 2009 , and i was blind in 2009 , ever been blind .
i thought , especially in my father , who passed away from the <unk> of surgery surgery .
similarly , just by the grasp of the <unk> , the changing nature of the ground , and then with the time , a notion of where you &apos;re and what you &apos;re doing .
but when i was going to <unk> and broadway , i was blessed in every corner .
if you design a city in the sense of the blind , there will be many , many jobs .
to give you a sense of that experience , the article was &quot; i think you &apos;re going to go through . &quot;
and the <unk> of the famous , i knew -- the ten commandments , love your next commandments , &quot; is fertile and <unk> you ...
you give money for a good purpose , and therefore makes emotion to help .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and <unk> from the sky .
so , this is actually the key to me , the key to remember that on the way you get here , the car doesn &apos;t <unk> , and i fell on the road on the stairs .
that was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to do this book , if we want to do anything , we really need to be into it , and with him rings .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics who were doing this work to <unk> , so we designed applications like this <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> on a laser laser on a laser .
alex was working on a small , some obscure <unk> <unk> with the name of &quot; minority report &quot; for steven &amp; gt , and asked us to develop the interface that should be used in the film .
we have this <unk> surgery , because we like yellow and <unk> on the green .
let &apos;s pull out apart : i teach it in <unk> .
we , as people , are the ones that are the things , and we should make sure that our machines help us and build it .
john , thank you that , &quot; thank you the science fiction .
what okolloh did was not possible without digital technologies .
but here is the point . the <unk> creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that will be shown by this black line , saying , &quot; we &apos;re changing this deal with it .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community .
and as all the good <unk> do you get a jump about 20 years when the interest in the audience changes .
you don &apos;t always have five days to go , and so changes , and we started playing <unk> .
india , but not really , to play with the <unk> game .
the other was cricket cricket .
was the new india ? this was a different world where you could get from all over the world , you could get the best players for the best players .
we &apos;ve seen games in calcutta , but that &apos;s what we had never seen before . <unk> khan brought the audience to the <unk> song -- for calcutta , not for india , not for <unk> .
could you imagine that this day would come up ?
hopefully , i &apos;ve got to have any of you to do a experience and the game game , and hopefully it &apos;s a long time in this business .
and you know that the dogs is actually , because they have <unk> the memory of how often you saw dogs and pigs on the rope .
why do you know , in the world , someone should play ?
on the other hand , if you visit a developing country , and for 25 dollars a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> for a big mac .
would you spend your spending 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i give you an example .
and if the way to the other end of the city to the 100 end of the city is worth 100 bucks , it doesn &apos;t matter where they &apos;re saving . but the people don &apos;t think about that .
well , in large , and all of it is tremendously impatient .
watch what happens when we fall down .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more about it . so you say that our answer is on terrorism , i mean , that he &apos;s a kind of mental error ?
there are no weapons of <unk> .
and so , some people see economists as dumb people .
and the theme of the variation and variation is one of these <unk> that requires certain intellectual activity , because you always compare the variation with the subject that you have in mind .
in fact , in the words , in fashion , the same rule / and too , very fantastic , not the first one thing that was new attempted , &quot; the last one that the old old is just the old old old . &quot;
and i woke up one day and said , &quot; well maybe it &apos;s not that ? &quot;
first , my willingness to be a critical audience , without suggesting , i am not to suggest .
it &apos;s my intention to be a poster to my own poster , they shouldn &apos;t have it .
so , in big , all of them , so they &apos;re going to survive .
jews often have a awkward smell of smell .
if the space was <unk> , we could see that people are giving more negative attitudes to the men &apos;s disease .
it &apos;s like i was talking about about what i did in those 20 years in the far .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , others , and they talk about what cinema is .
without food , i was sick .
we don &apos;t need to have the stupid , catching the stupid .
our government was corrupt .
so , for me , the thought that we have all these children , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children who had to have been through so much psychological <unk> and africa has to live through with life .
through the book , more than an hour of <unk> and interactive animation .
so what is the business ?
it seemed at least the idea that you could have to be , but it was always true true true .
so i thought , &quot; yeah , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
the talk is still about it .
when i came from college , i worked in southern california , and you went on the spanish <unk> on the rooftops and these things .
rsw : what about his schedule ?
the <unk> -- they &apos;ve been told me to interviewed and have their technical <unk> to bilbao .
that &apos;s reminded me of it .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; so , what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you &apos;d three to three months , the ideas will always be more and more and living .
and one thing that i wanted to mention in my <unk> , but somehow , was it , to thank all the business that helped me to the order of the .
but in the meantime , these things are going to make .
and this is 10 weeks later , by hand .
you see the suits , the <unk> .
the <unk> of <unk> and things is remarkable , and that &apos;s going to be the <unk> .
it &apos;s an incredible undertaking , 15,000 worker , i think , five leg , and the sixth is here .
on this level to 1,500 workers .
50 percent of the computer in the world is to recycling in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan that less than five percent of an ad in an image of the world &apos;s .
and i wish to be , <unk> . i was told myself a , and i always wanted to work with something .
and it will be increasingly important that we find out how we can make these resources from these very complex <unk> .
the traditional ways of dividing material , it simply doesn &apos;t work for <unk> .
the traditional path of making <unk> , is happening with oil or petrochemicals .
the end of this process , we have a mixed <unk> : many different kinds of <unk> and many different qualities of plastic .
now i see a lot of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to make mistakes in the same way , and again , again .
maybe we should study how apes make decisions and find out whether they make the same <unk> of what we do .
here &apos;s mayday . it &apos;s going to trade a token for food and waits to forage and you &apos;re happy .
they &apos;re also waiting for a little bit of that the market opens up .
now imagine that i &apos;ll give each of you 1,000 <unk> dollars in the hand -- so 10 hundred dollars a hundred notes .
you can either choose a <unk> loss -- so i throw a coin . you &apos;re really losing a lot .
if we were in our little <unk> of these same scenarios , they would be the same things like people do ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people in the last stage of development that make dumb mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think of buildings , they are just four stories .
we need less with concrete and steel and we need to build up , in the last time we &apos;ve worked on <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s as much as we would have spent 900 cars on the streets of 900 cars .
<unk> curtains my windows .
perhaps even &quot; citizen , &quot; because recently , they stood up to fight the crimes of the justice , the citizens of these networks are together to help each other .
<unk> , the biggest and oldest bank in russia , largely , most of the state of the rwandan government , using <unk> <unk> to employees and citizens in development of innovation .
we heard about the talks about people who are hacked to have hacked , and <unk> works on the world to motivate young people to create websites and take video sites .
and so i started thinking that eternal mother always asks , &quot; are all children there ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to convey a message , and all of them in their own language , a central <unk> , which was a version of the golden rule , &quot; what you &apos;re going to do you to do not to do not . &quot;
a pastor is to be a pastor , to take care of all this individual needs .
and we do this by some <unk> .
there &apos;s over 180 messages in washington d.c.
that &apos;s already taken by parks and sculpture .
it &apos;s made of <unk> fiber .
there &apos;s also some constraints on its illumination .
the bubble is a <unk> .
i saw my aunt being raped when i was five .
one of the things that i experienced when i was trying to eat my friend because we didn &apos;t eat food , and we had 400 were to the 400 .
as a child , as young and <unk> , words i can &apos;t forget , forget .
that &apos;s my story , shared in a sense of a lesson .
my breakfast , my lunch , i sponsor , i i i started to a foundation that i started , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yes !
the third chapter is a more more more complicated called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent are .
we &apos;re going to solve this task on the very death by using the death penalty .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
the santa <unk> knows whether or not you &apos;re <unk> or not . &quot;
but julie , you were so ready to school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiled , in the sense , that was the right answer , and then they asked them , &quot; do you know that we all brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your major capacity to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the toughest view of the modern times : &quot; the road . &quot;
in second world war ii , we had to make a lot of stuff .
but we cannot forget that it takes a fundamental contribution to it , and that is how many resources of the planet we use .
but now , too good news !
it &apos;s maybe in latin america .
and at that point , the skeptics will come to the the skeptics and <unk> of climate change .
we did a project for the <unk> project , a big program , which was called the <unk> -- with many , many people -- many people -- many people -- many people -- all the people -- all the case -- a thicker <unk> .
a group of them to do it for themselves and the other group should spend it for other people .
when they walked from the first building to a guy , all of the guy who hangs himself and roamed , and it needed help . the question is : they thought it and helped ?
the word is &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; a combination of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called the , and stuff that &apos;s hidden things of things .
since -- it &apos;s now four decades -- i &apos;ve been trained with the best in this field , and i &apos;ve been teaching the best in this field , and i met , created <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> a gigantic web of art , successes and accolades .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my passion , my real life life .
i danced between <unk> and <unk> and urged him to fit these in my <unk> .
well , it was essentially a frustration .
that &apos;s what it was at that time .
he put together , put this together something together , and then he got it into this software , which i think that it was originally designed his son . and he did this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there &apos;s little <unk> , little boxes .
so i would rather to suggest -- yes , you make a beautiful website , how could i say you shouldn &apos;t make a beautiful website ?
now , you ask the linked data that they put together now , 32 hits , which everyone is a protein with these properties and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s linked data .
all this is going to lead to two million children every year , and over year 2000 , than year 2000 .
and if it is so , we &apos;re willing to get feedback to feedback feedback and to make sure that the claims promises really deliver results ?
you just just showing one of the numbers there , the 5,000 -- is that number ?
my brothers started to draw my brothers and drawing and drawing .
and that &apos;s exactly what fascinates me to explore this area .
how many of you have a cow about the street , from bangalore after mysore ?
it &apos;s just as people we &apos;re trained as people who perceive reality , and that makes the meaning .
and they said , &quot; well , fine .
can &apos;t you do anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box of <unk> .
because if we see somebody by , then we see the footprint .
what percentage of them have made foreign <unk> <unk> ?
obviously , he &apos;s been the last 20,000 years in a cave .
so the main thing is actually just be fine to come up here to the degree , because -- if you think about it , i told you about the economists &apos; economist , i told that most things are very <unk> .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re now going to get some technical .
think of toyota .
you can &apos;t get to <unk> , so they accept it and find a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to be .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
pizza you get to pizza if they have hunger .
there are millions of different types .
so remember , when we think about sexual education and activities are you out of baseball .
it &apos;s the poet <unk> chen , and it &apos;s like , &quot; i can &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> .
and that is , &quot; how much one of the day you think of that person ? &quot;
in the <unk> societies , people have left <unk> <unk> <unk> .
they came home with <unk> percent of the <unk> .
and it was really becoming a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think that men are women women ? &quot;
and not a time on this was , the women were so kind of being educated , so interesting , so interesting .
she &apos;s 23 her she &apos;s been her since they &apos;ve 13 .
i started to <unk> why you were in love with a person in love than in the other .
and they &apos;re going to be as long as the human race is on what shakespeare is called the spiral spiral . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should ask ourselves , whether it could be that resistance , the cause resistance that is the cause of weight and disease disease -- at least most people ?
others , it &apos;s too much more nuanced .
peter <unk> : what if our beliefs were wrong about diabetes ?
my great great , henry ford , believed that it was the mission of ford motor company , the life of the people to improve and make cars affordable to everyone .
and the good news is that we &apos;re now doing the big problems of cars and the environment -- not only at ford , but it &apos;s total of industry .
i think you can imagine it already .
but what i really inspired me is the possibilities that we will have , when our cars start to communicate with each other .
we need a infrastructure that is capable of supporting this <unk> future .
this is a minute .
i think now , my mother , i mean , i mean , is this kind of <unk> .
and the nurse needs to put data up .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s a lot . &quot;
so what about this came out ?
it also was great for us , because we won a lot of awards .
i was infected when i was 17 , at the time , when a student was a <unk> student , i was the adults who believed that were really on my ideas , and many <unk> <unk> <unk> with me .
now it &apos;s about the children . so we don &apos;t <unk> .
and basically , we gave the children a simple task .
for our auction , we have some wonderful images for them , for a really good purpose , the money that they give us , is being used to buy aids aids .
but what i &apos;ve never said , and what i want to do is that it &apos;s cool .
in a way , in a elegant elegant , or <unk> , the product that we have <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a more kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible kind of out-of-body experience .
if you think about change in our societies , the <unk> of the country in the cities that took 200 years , the same process in 20 years .
it saw changes changes , though that was not unknown .
so , for example , we would put the models under a of the sky .
